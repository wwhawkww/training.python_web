                  From Planet PostgreSQL.

        <a href="http://www.ivc.com/" target="_blank">IVC</a>, a great boutique software house that I have worked with for quite a few years, has been shifting to a new, more modern, software stack, part of which is <a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a>. They have asked me to work on improving the interface between Redis and PostgreSQL. Last week they mentioned that they are doing a lot with Redis hashes, and asked me to improve access to them. These are basically sets of key/value pairs. In PostgreSQL terms think of hstore for an equivalent. <br /><br />So I came up with a simple idea of mapping a foreign table to a Redis hash. This actually isn't too hard to implement, and I got it working more or less yesterday:<br /><br /><blockquote><pre>andrew=# \! echo type foo | redis-cli<br />hash<br />andrew=# \d xxx<br />       Foreign table "public.xxx"<br /> Column | Type | Modifiers | FDW Options <br />--------+------+-----------+-------------<br /> key    | text |           | <br /> value  | text |           | <br />Server: localredis<br />FDW Options: (hashkey 'foo')<br /><br />andrew=# select * from xxx;<br />   key   | value <br />---------+-------<br /> bar     | baz<br /> blurflk | asdf<br /> qqq     | ttt<br />(3 rows)<br /></pre></blockquote>So far so good. You can treat a Redis hash as a little table and select from it. And we could perform similar operations for the other Redis data structures (lists, sets and zsets).&nbsp; But I'm wondering if this is going to fit well with actual Redis practice. Let's say we're dealing with web session objects. In PostgreSQL you would probably have a table for these with a session id and an hstore or maybe a piece of json (especially after my json extractor functions get committed :-) ). But in Redis I think you're at least as likely to have one hash per session object rather than a hash of session objects, and Redis data structures don't nest, so there's no hash of hashes. So if you have thousands or millions of tiny session object hashes in Redis, with names like "web.session.a9f3c1763d" where the last part of the name is some fairly opaque session name, do you really want to be having to map each one of those to its own foreign table in order to be able to read the values nicely? I don't think so.<br /><br />Following this thought I came up with the idea of a related FDW which would give you access to the whole of the hashspace in Redis. The tables would have three fields, not two, being, say, (hashname, key value). We could even impose a restriction on queries that would require you to specify a hashname, although that's possibly a bit ugly, and maybe we should just warn you against not supplying a hashkey query parameter.<br /><br />So, which of these patterns is likely to be most useful? They are not actually mutually exclusive, and it's perfectly possible to implement both. But I would like to know what seems most useful to Redis users generally, especially if they are also using PostgreSQL.<br /><br />Another possibility would be not to use the Foreign Data Wrapper interface at all, and just provide a set returning function which would take some connection parameters and a hash name and return the key value pairs. This too would be reasonably easy to do, as I already have (and will soon publish) a framework for generalised Redis access. On the other hand, one significant advantage of using Foreign Data Wrappers is that with FDWs handling pushed down quals ("where" conditions in effect) is rather easier to do, from what I can see.

        <p class="discreet">

                Published on <span name="publication_time">Jan 21, 2013</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Based on feedback from users and contributors, Pyrseas now sports two enhancements.</p>
<h2>Multi-line String Formatting</h2>
<p>Up to Pyrseas 0.6, long textual elements such as view definitions, function source text and long object comments, would usually be shown in the YAML output as quoted strings with embedded newlines. Here are two examples from the <a href="http://www.rbt.ca/autodoc/output.html">autodoc</a> database:</p>
<pre>schema product:
  description: "This schema stores a list of products and information\n about the\
    \ product"
...
schema warehouse:
  view products:
    definition: " SELECT DISTINCT product.product_id, product.product_code, product.product_description\n\
      \   FROM warehouse.inventory\n   JOIN product.product USING (product_id);"</pre>
<p>As you can imagine, this was particularly unsatisfactory for complex functions and views. Thanks to preliminary work by <a href="http://braintrace.ru/">Andrey Popp</a>, Pyrseas 0.7 will be able to format these elements in <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/current.html#block%20scalar%20style/syntax">YAML block style</a>. The above elements will be shown as follows:</p>
<pre>schema product:
  description: |-
    This schema stores a list of products and information
     about the product
...
schema warehouse:
  view products:
    definition: |2-
       SELECT DISTINCT product.product_id, product.product_code, product.product_description
         FROM warehouse.inventory
         JOIN product.product USING (product_id);</pre>
<p>Thanks to testing by Josep Martínez, 0.7 will also properly display and handle such strings even when they include non-ASCII characters such as accented characters. For example, in 0.6, &#8220;Martínez&#8221; would be shown as &#8220;Mart\xEDnez&#8221;. In 0.7, the output will be the original UTF-8 string.</p>
<h2>Directory of Database Objects</h2>
<p>Pyrseas 0.6 has a single format for output by <a href="http://pyrseas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dbtoyaml.html">dbtoyaml</a> or input into <a href="http://pyrseas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/yamltodb.html">yamltodb</a>: a single YAML-formatted file. This becomes a problem when your database has hundreds or more tables, functions, etc (let alone <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/attachments/193_pgCon%202011%20-%20Managing%20Terabytes.pdf">409,994 tables and counting!</a>). Furthermore, as dbtoyaml and yamltodb are intended to assist with database version control, your team may want to store individual object specifications in your version control system, or you may want to diff individual objects.</p>
<p>The 0.7 <tt>--directory</tt> option to dbtoyaml and yamltodb allows you to split the YAML spec into multiple files in a directory (or folder) tree. For example, using the dbtoyaml -d option on the autodoc database results in the following tree (shown under Linux using <tt>ls -RF</tt>):</p>
<pre>.:

<p>As can be seen, each schema gets its own directory wherein are stored each object belonging to that schema. In addition to schemas, the root level also stores non-schema owned objects such as foreign data wrappers and extensions (the latter can be placed in a schema, but are not owned by it).</p>
<p>The directory tree and multi-line string formats are still under review, so I&#8217;d like to encourage you to test both enhancements and <a href="https://github.com/jmafc/Pyrseas/issues">provide feedback</a>.</p>

        Today was my last day at 2ndQuadrant.<br /><br />The experience of working with 2ndQuadrant in the last couple of years has been very positive.&nbsp;I just decided it was time for a change.&nbsp;Being able to work on interesting problems during my time at 2ndQuadrant, both as a Postgres developer and as a consultant has been great fun, and very personally rewarding.&nbsp;I would like to acknowledge the invaluable support of both Simon Riggs and Greg Smith - thank you both. I wish the entire 2ndQuadrant staff all the best.<br /><br />I expect to remain active as a Postgres developer, and already have plans to relocate to work for another company that is well known within the community.

        <p>As interest in PostgreSQL grows, so does the rate at which new patches are proposed. To maintain the high level of quality in PostgreSQL it is important that all patches be checked and reviewed, so that what gets added to the codebase is good quality.</p>
<p>Some of this evaluation requires a lot of expertise in the PostgreSQL core code, but most of it requires little development experience at all. The more initial checking and review gets done before patches get evaluated by the experts, the less work those experts have to do. So: please step up and review a patch. There are <a href="http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/craigs-planetpostgresql/feed/">patch review guidelines on the wiki</a>, and it&#8217;s quite an accessible process. Step right up if you want to contribute a little back to the software you use and rely on, or if there&#8217;s a particular enhancement you want to make sure goes into 9.3.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t feel up to reviewing the feature you&#8217;re interested in, you can still help by testing and initially reviewing something else, so others have more time to examine the complicated stuff. You can still help out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series on patches proposed for 9.3, starting with today&#8217;s patch, Peter Eisentraut&#8217;s addition of a <tt>ALTER ROLE</tt> extension to change PostgreSQL settings (like <tt>work_mem</tt>, <tt>search_path</tt>, etc) for all users on all databases. The <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/50F55F5A.3050207@gmx.net">initial post explaining the patch is here</a> and <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/action/patch_view?id=1060">this is the commitfest entry</a>.</p>
<p>To get involved, <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/action/commitfest_view?id=17">visit the current commitfest page</a>, sign in with your PostgreSQL community login, and have a look at the <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/action/commitfest_view?id=17&amp;status=1">list of patches needing review</a>. If there&#8217;s one there that doesn&#8217;t have an existing reviewer listed, or that interests you, please get involved! Grab the patch, read the reviewer guidelines, and help make PostgreSQL better.</p>

<p>Interested users are needed to try out the following patches and report back with their experiences if you want to see these changes in 9.3:</p>
<p>The patches are:</p>
<p>Add a new event type of object_access_hook named OAT_POST_ALTER. This allows extensions to catch controls just after system catalogs are updated. Patch also adds sepgsql permission check capability on some ALTER commands, but not all.<br />

        <p>We discussed a while back the <a href="http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/251-File-FDW-Family-Part-2-file_textarray_fdw-Foreign-Data-Wrapper.html" target="_blank">Text array foreign data wrapper</a> that allows you to register and query a delimited file as if it were a regular table with one array column.
It's probably the FDW we use most often and reminded of that recently when I had to query a 500,000 record resident list tab delimited file to prep for geocoding.</p>

<p>When we upgraded to 9.2 and we could no longer compile, I wrote to Andrew Dunstan about this and <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/andrew/index.php?/archives/291-File-Text-Array-FDW-changes.html" target="_blank">he kindly created a 9.2 version</a>.
Unfortunately there are still quite a few FDWs broken as a result of the 9.2 changes and I was hoping to try to apply similar patches to them that I saw Andrew do, but
haven't had the patience or time yet. Anyway we've compiled these for 9.2 under our mingw64-w64 and mingw64-w32 chains using Andrew's 9.2 GitHub stable branch.

and we've tested them using the PostgreSQL EDB windows VC++ compiled versions. We hope you find them as useful as we have.

</ul>
<p>I'm hoping to add more FDWs to these 9.2 bags once
we have those working again. If you want to compile yourself or compile others, we have instructions in the packaged README.txt.</p>

        The <a href="http://multicorn.org/">Multicorn</a> project makes it possible to write Foreign Data Wrappers for PostgreSQL in Python.<br /><br />To install Multicorn on RHEL6 the following is needed:<br /><ul><li>PostgreSQL 9.2</li><li>Python 2.7</li><li>make, GCC, etc.</li></ul>Installing PostgreSQL 9.2 is easy as it's available in the <a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Yum repository</a>.<br /><br />Unfortunately Python 2.7 is not included in RHEL6. And replacing the 'system' python is a bad idea.<br /><br />The solution is to do an 'altinstall' of Python. The "--shared" and ucs4 options are required. The altinstall will install a python binary with the name python2.7 instead of just python. This allows you to have multiple python versions on 1 system.<br /><br /><span>wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/Python-2.7.3.tgz</span><br /><span>tar zxf Python-2.7.3.tgz</span><br /><span>cd Python-2.7.3</span><br /><span>./configure --shared --enable-unicode=ucs4</span><br /><span>make</span><br /><span>make altinstall </span><br /><br />This will result in a /usr/local/bin/python2.7 which doesn't work.

        The SOLID design approach is a set of principles developed in object-oriented programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This series will explore the applicability of these principles to Object-Relational databases, and contrast the way in which they manifest from the way in which they manifest in the application layer.<br /><br />You can't program a database like you'd program an application.&nbsp; The database essentially serves two twin functions:&nbsp; a persistence store, and a model of information derivable from that store.&nbsp; The ACID consistency model therefore limits what sorts of programming you can reasonably do in the database because it is a bad idea, outside of logging, to mix transactional and non-transactional side effects.<br /><br />As an information model, the approach taken by applying these approaches then is relatively different.&nbsp; One way to think of it is that if object oriented design might be seen as a triangle, applying this in the db requires turning that triangle upside down so you have a flat base to build your application on.<br /><br />This series will look at applying SOLID principles to object-relational database design, comparing and contrasting the way in which the principles get applied to that of general software development.&nbsp; Many aspects of relational design in fact play into these topics and so one ends up with a very different mix than one might have with pure object-oriented design.<br /><br />In general this series continues to look at relations as sets of objects rather than sets of tuples.&nbsp; This means that the question is how we define data structures and interfaces so that we can bridge object and relational worlds in the database.&nbsp; The SOLID principles are good starting points but the sort of logic done is fundamentally different and so they are applied in different ways.<br /><br />Welcome to the series.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy it.

        <p><a href="http://www.nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hosting.png"><img alt="Hosting Decisions" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1046" height="300" src="http://www.nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hosting-225x300.png" width="225" /></a>Where do you fit on this scale?</p>
<p>Sysadmin -&gt; DBA -&gt; Backend Programmer -&gt; Frontend Programmer -&gt; Designer</p>
<p>I have a range in the middle, but lack on each end of the spectrum. So when it comes to setting up a hosting server, I&#8217;d rather turn it over to someone more experienced in the sysadmin realm. But, when bootstrapping a startup, you find yourself becoming a jack of all trades (and master of none).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in the process of re-writing <a href="http://inzolo.com" target="_blank">Inzolo</a> and re-launching as <a href="https://envelopebudget.com" target="_blank">Envelope Budget</a>. It recently came time to launch (ready or not). I spent way more time than I intended setting up a hosting account. I have been hosting Inzolo on <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=redseam" target="_blank">Webfaction</a> since its inception. Overall I&#8217;ve been quite pleased. I don&#8217;t really have any performance or downtime issues that I can remember, Webfaction has a nice interface to set up everything I need. I&#8217;ve actually been pleasantly surprised in how it has met my needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of buzz about <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> though. And so, I thought I&#8217;d try deploying there before I went live. First of all, let me explain my stack. EnvelopeBudget.com is written in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> and I&#8217;m using PostgreSQL as my database. I&#8217;m making use of <a href="http://packages.python.org/johnny-cache/" target="_blank">johnny-cache</a> and using Memcached to speed up the site a bit. I wrote a utility to import Inzolo accounts into Envelope Budget and found that I finally had a real *need* for asynchronous processing, so I implemented <a href="http://celeryproject.org/" target="_blank">Celery</a> and <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a> to process the import and return status updates to the browser.</p>
<p>I was impressed after doing the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django" target="_blank">Getting Started with Django tutorial</a> on Heroku. What kind of magic is this? So I attempted to get my EnvelopeBudget stack up and running next. I modified my <a href="http://www.deploydjango.com/django_project_structure/index.html" target="_blank">django project structure</a> to be more Heroku friendly. I probably spend a good 8 hours leaning how Heroku makes deployment so simple though it never really seemed simple. I got it up and running but in the end I decided it wasn&#8217;t for me (at least for this project) mainly due to the price. Minimally it would cost me $55 per month because I needed two dynos (one web and one worker), and the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/ssl" target="_blank">SSL add-on</a>. Seriously, why do they charge $20 per month to use SSL? SSL set up is free on the other 3 hosting plans I&#8217;m reviewing here. That was probably the biggest deal breaker. Also, this price was for using the dev <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql" target="_blank">PostgreSQL add-on</a> which wouldn&#8217;t last long. Soon I&#8217;d need to upgrade to the Basic ($9/mo) or Crane ($50/mo) package. So, now my hosting was looking more like $105 per month. On top of that, you deploy by pushing to git (&#8216;git push heroku master&#8217;). This is cool, but it seemed to take forever each time. It was annoying since I had to keep committing and pushing to troubleshoot problems. Deploying with fabric is much faster for me on the other three servers. Time to move on.</p>
<p>So at this point I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;ll just go back to Webfaction. As I&#8217;m riding the train home from work and reading through my twitter feed I come across a link to a <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/2E3lEq/www.apreche.net/complete-single-server-django-stack-tutorial/" target="_blank">Complete Single Server Django Stack Tutorial</a>. I read through it and it suddenly didn&#8217;t seem so scary setting my up own server. I&#8217;ve don&#8217;t pretty much all of this before on my own development environment. So, I go to the best place I know to spin up a new server fast &#8211; <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=0e672eb6d53973f0ac51b6d8e95a067f55a676bb" target="_blank">Linode</a>. It probably took me about 2 hours to get everything up and running. I took copious notes along the way though. After getting it to work on the 512 plan ($20 per month), I destroyed that linode and set it up again on a 1 GB plan ($40/month). It took about 40 minute the second time (setting it up twice was faster than figuring out Heroku). I was surprised at how much faster the performance was on Lindode. Webfaction &amp; Heroku felt about the same, but Linode felt significantly faster.</p>
<p>After getting it all set up I got a <a href="https://twitter.com/cliftonite/status/291612158268153856" target="_blank">tweet from a friend</a> recommending I try out <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> while I&#8217;m at it. After looking at the prices and specs, I could get a 1 GB server for half the price and it had an SSD to make it faster &#8211; but only one core instead of 4. I took the time to set it up. The process was pretty much the same as with Linode. It only took about 30 minutes this time. Overall the site felt slower than Linode though. I&#8217;m guessing it was due to having only one core and because I&#8217;m located in Utah, my Linode was in Texas and DigitalOcean is New York. Still, installing packages seemed to take a lot longer so I&#8217;m thinking it was their data center&#8217;s internet speed that was source of slower speeds. Sorry, I don&#8217;t have any benchmarks so I can&#8217;t really give real numbers. One thing that really impressed me though was the reboot time of the server. It seemed about 5 times faster than my linode likely due to the SSD.</p>
<p>So, now it was time to make a choice. I had a launch counter ticking down on my homepage and I had to decide NOW. I had already spent 3 days making a decision. I finally decided to go with Webfaction&#8217;s 1 GB plan which is $40 per month (or $30 per month if paid yearly). I like the idea of having a managed plan. The biggest downside for me is that I don&#8217;t have root or sudo access. They don&#8217;t use virtualenv for their application setup and setting up projects is a bit kludgy felling because of it. Also, setting up Celery &amp; RabbitMQ doesn&#8217;t feel as painless, but I managed it thanks to <a href="http://www.markliu.me/2011/sep/29/django-celery-on-webfaction-using-rabbitmq/" target="_blank">Mark Liu&#8217;s tutorial</a>. I know there is a way to use virtualenv and gunicorn on Webfaction, but I doubt I&#8217;ll take the time to set my project up that way.</p>
<p>There was a snag though. I had originally set up my account on their most basic account with only has 256 MB of RAM. My site was already killed for running 2x that amount. I needed to upgrade ASAP but I need someone there to set up the new account and migrate my existing account. So I actually ended up launching on Linode. The site is up now and hosting performance is great, but I will likely move back to Webfaction because I soon started to realize there is always something else to set up. I have a git repo, a <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" target="_blank">Trac</a> system, email, &amp; FTP already set up on Webfaction. I would likely want to put a wordpress blog at /blog. All of this is so easy with Webfaction and its more I have to research to do all of this on Linode.</p>
<p>So here is my tl;dr version in alphabetical order:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>: I love their pricing. For as little as $5 per month I can spin up a linux server. This would be great for a <a href="http://www.nerdydork.com/setting-up-a-znc-irc-bouncer.html" target="_blank">ZNC IRC bouncer</a> for example. They seem fairly new still so time will tell how they compete with Linode. Their internet connection seemed a bit slow, but for root access to a server, it can be overlooked.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>: If I were a hipster I&#8217;d bite the bullet and host here to get in with the cool crowd. Overall it was just too expensive for a bootstrapped startup project. The biggest benefit I see with Heroku is the ability to scale fast, both forwards and backwards when you need to. Scaling is a good problem to have. If I get to that that point, money won&#8217;t be an issue and I will revisit Heroku. I would probably also use it if I built a very small site where the specs fit within their free model or if I was in the middle of a hack-a-thon and needed to get online fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=0e672eb6d53973f0ac51b6d8e95a067f55a676bb" target="_blank">Linode</a>: This seems to be the standard for spinning up your own dedicated server with root access. If I root access, performance and a history of good support, I&#8217;ll go here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=redseam" target="_blank">Webfaction</a>: I&#8217;ve been around the block and learned that the grass is not really greener on the other side. Although I don&#8217;t have root access and it&#8217;s hosted on CentOS rather than Debian/Ubuntu which I&#8217;m more familiar with, it has so many features for making it easy to set up email, multiple domains, SSL, different types of apps (Django + PHP + Ruby on Rails anyone?), Trac, Git, etc. The price is competative, the support is good, the uptime and performance is good &#8211; I haven&#8217;t found sufficient reason to leave.</p>

        Last week Gurjeet Singh asked me about getting the MinGW64 compiler working. When I looked I noticed that they has not made an official build for Mingw hosts (as opposed to linux hosts and darwin hosts) since late 2011. I went on IRC and asked why, and was told that they had switched to GYP to generate builds and it was broken on Mingw. Apparently nobody in the GYP project is interested in fixing it because Mingw isn't one of their supported platforms. Someone gave me this URL that describes the problem: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2197#c6" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2197#c6</a><br /><br />I was, as they say, gobsmacked. Nobody even really seemed to care that much.<br /><br />If the build tool doesn't support one of your three main target platforms, and moreover it's the only target which <b>isn't</b> cross-compiling, <b>STOP USING IT</b>.<br /><br />

        So we're finally beginning the final playoffs for 9.3 features, otherwise known as "CommitFest 4".&nbsp; Here's where we are on the various features which have been discussed, proposed, submitted, or thought about for 9.3.&nbsp; The "likely/uncertain" is my own judgement based on the activity I've seen on the feature so far, and may not reflect the project consensus (although it does largely reflect the "needs review/ready for committer" split on those patches).<br /><br />I've also probably missed stuff. Mostly this is by not seeing some patches as significant, which actually are. <br /><br />As you can see, what's already committed would make a respectable release for any other DBMS.&nbsp; But here at PostgreSQL, we don't believe that there's any such thing as "enough features".&nbsp;&nbsp; If your database can't process 16TB of data with six nines of uptime, parallelize all your application logic, make breakfast and drive the kids to school without waking you up, we still have work to do!<br /><br />Already Committed:<br /><ul><li>Use POSIX shared memory: no more SHMMAX</li><li>LATERAL subqueries</li><li>Streaming-only Cascading and Remastering </li><li>extend large object access to 4TB (was 2GB)</li><li>Improve pg_upgrade performance</li><li>COPY FREEZE mode</li><li>Automatically updatable views</li><li>Create your own background workers </li><li>configuration file directories</li><li>additional ALTER, IF NOT EXISTS objects </li><li>pg_basebackup starts replica automatically</li><li>pg_terminate, pg_cancel your own queries</li><li>SP-GiST indexing for Range Types</li></ul>Pending CF4, Looking Likely:<br /><ul><li>Writeable Foreign Tables</li><li>PostgreSQL database federation (pgsql_fdw)</li><li>LOCK TIMEOUT</li><li>Event Triggers</li><li>pg_retainxlog</li><li>Improved Foreign Key locking (FOR KEY SHARE)</li><li>Recursive VIEWs</li><li>Improved performance for SP-GiST and Range Types</li><li>Merging recovery.conf into postgresql.conf</li><li>pg_ping utility</li><li>Additional JSON features and built-in functions</li></ul><br />In CF4, Uncertain:<br /><ul><li>Logical Streaming Replication, and its many dependant patches.</li><li>Data page checksums</li><li>Auto-updated Materialized Views</li><li>Reducing Hint Bit I/O</li><li>Storing counts, other data in GIN indexes</li><li>Row-Level Security and dependant SEPgSQL features.</li><li>xlogreader</li><li>use pg_receivexlog for promotion</li><li>REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</li><li>Parallel pg_dump</li></ul>Already Bounced to 9.4:<br /><ul><li>pg_dump file-per-object format ("split")</li><li>Trim Trailing NULLs optimization</li><li>Automatic audit logging ("timing events")</li><li>TABLESAMPLE</li><li>pg_stats_lwlocks view</li><li>array foreign keys</li></ul>Never Got Worked On in 9.3:<br /><ul><li>Query parallelization</li><li>UPSERT/MERGE</li><li>Merge joins for Ranges</li><li>Global temp tables</li><li>Temp tables on Replicas</li><li>Reordering database columns</li><li>Spatial JOIN</li><li>special JSON GiST Indexes</li></ul>If your favorite feature is in the "never got worked on" or the "already bounced", it's a bit too late to do anything about it.

        <p>Another day, another migration from <em>MySQL</em> to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>... or at least
that's how it feels sometimes. This time again I've been using some quite
old scripts to help me do the migration.</p>

<center>
<p><img alt="" src="http://tapoueh.org/../../images/dauphin-logo.jpg" /></p>
</center>

<center>
<p><em>That's how I feel for MySQL users</em></p>
</center>

<h3>Migrating the schema</h3>

<p class="first">For the <em>schema</em> parts, I've been using <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/mysql2pgsql/">mysql2pgsql</a> with success for many
years. This tool is not complete and will do only about <em>80%</em> of the work. As
I think that the schema should always be validated manually when doing a
migration anyway, I happen to think that it's good news.</p>


<h3>Getting the data out</h3>

<p class="first">Then for the data parts I keep on using <a href="http://tapoueh.org/../../pgsql/pgloader.html">pgloader</a>. The data is never quite
right, and the ability to filter out what you can't readily import in a
<em>reject</em> file proves itself a a must have here. The problems you have in the
exported MySQL data are quite serious:</p>

<center>
<p><img alt="" src="http://tapoueh.org/../../images/data-unlocked.320.png" /></p>
</center>

<center>
<p><em>Can I have my data please?</em></p>
</center>

<p>First, date formating is not compatible with what PostgreSQL expects,
sometimes using <code>20130117143218</code> instead of what we expect: <code>2013-01-17
14:32:18</code>, and of course even when the format is right (that seems to depend
on the MySQL server's version), you still have to transform the <code>0000-00-00
00:00:00</code> into <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">
Before thinking about the usage of that particular date rather than
using <code>NULL</code> when you don't have the information, you might want to
remember that there's no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(year)">year zero</a> in the calendar, it's year 1 BC and
then year 1.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Then, text encoding is often mixed up, even when the MySQL databases are
said to be in <em>latin1</em> or <em>unicode</em>, you somehow always end up finding texts in
<em>win1252</em> or some other <em>code page</em> in there.</p>

<p>And of course, MySQL provides no tool to export the data to <code>CSV</code>, so you have
to come up with your own. The <code>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</code> command on the server
produces non conforming CSV (<code>\n</code> can appear in non-escaped field contents),
and while the <code>mysql</code> client manual page details that it outputs <code>CSV</code> when
stdout is not a terminal, it won't even try to quote fields or escape <code>\t</code>
when they appear in the data.</p>

<p>So, we use the <a href="https://github.com/slardiere/mysqltocsv">mysqltocsv</a> little script to export the data, and then use
that data to feed <a href="http://tapoueh.org/../../pgsql/pgloader.html">pgloader</a>.</p>


<h3>Loading the data in</h3>

<p class="first">Now, we have to write down a configuration file for pgloader to know what to
load and where to find the data. What about generating the file from the
database schema instead, using the query in <a href="http://tapoueh.org/rss/generate-pgloader-config.sql">generate-pgloader-config.sql</a>:</p>

<p>To work with the setup generated, you will have to prepend a global section
for pgloader and to include a reformating module in python, that I named
<a href="http://tapoueh.org/rss/mynull.py">mynull.py</a>:</p>

<pre class="src">
<span># Author: Dimitri Fontaine &lt;<a href="mailto:dimitri@2ndQuadrant.fr">dimitri&#64;2ndQuadrant.fr</a>&gt;
#
# pgloader mysql reformating module
</span>
<span>def</span> <span>timestamp</span>(reject, <span>input</span>):
    <span>""" Reformat str as a PostgreSQL timestamp

    MySQL timestamps are ok this time:  2012-12-18 23:38:12
    But may contain the infamous all-zero date, where we want NULL.
    """</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>input</span> == <span>'0000-00-00 00:00:00'</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>input</span>

<span>def</span> <span>date</span>(reject, <span>input</span>):
    <span>""" date columns can also have '0000-00-00'"""</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>input</span> == <span>'0000-00-00'</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>input</span>
</pre>

<p>Now you can launch <code>pgloader</code> and profit!</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p class="first">There are plenty of tools to assist you migrating away from MySQL and other
databases. When you make that decision, you're not alone, and it's easy
enough to find people to come and help you.</p>

<p>While MySQL is Open Source and is not a <em>lock in</em> from a licencing
perspective, I still find it hard to swallow that there's no provided tools
for getting data out in a sane format, and that so many little
inconsistencies exist in the product with respect to data handling (try to
have a <code>NOT NULL</code> column, then enjoy the default empty strings that have been
put in there). So at this point, yes, I consider that moving to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
is a way to <em>free your data</em>:</p>

        </p>

        <p>I just confirmed the cause an extremely weird problem that&#8217;s been frustrating me for days. I want to share it so nobody else has to waste their time on this.</p>
<p>It appears that &#8211; at least on my build machine, a Windows 7 SP1 x64 box with Windows SDK 7.1, Visual Studio 2010 Express SP1 and Visual Studio Express 2012 on it &#8211; <tt>vcregress check</tt> will hang indefinitely with a <tt>postgres.exe</tt> process sitting at 100% cpu <i>if the regression tests are run in a path that is too deep</i>. This seems to happen with both x64 and x86 builds.</p>
<p><tt>git.exe</tt> seems to have a similar problem, where a <tt>git clean -fdx</tt> in a deep directory tree will sit at 100% cpu forever, making no progress.</p>
<p>In both <tt>git.exe</tt>&#8216;s and <tt>postgres.exe's</tt> cases, Process Monitor shows a steam of <tt>QueryNameInformationFile</tt> events with result <tt>BUFFER OVERFLOW</tt>. <a href="http://forum.sysinternals.com/simple-question_topic22038.html"><tt>QueryNameInformationFile</tt> is the <tt>IRP_MJ_QUERY_INFORMATION</tt> operation of <tt>ZwQueryInformationFile</tt></a> as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff545817.aspx">documented in MSDN here</a>. It&#8217;s a kernel-level operation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m yet to determine the root cause of the issue. To work around the problem, build in a shallower directory tree.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve included a bunch of details after the cut, primarily to help anyone else with this problem find this post. </p>

<p>This works:</p>

<p>The <tt>postgres.exe</tt> backend the test is running on sits at 100% cpu (or rather, 50% because it&#8217;s 100% of one core on a dual core box). It cannot be terminated via Task Manager or Process Explorer &#8211; End Task appears to succeed without error, but doesn&#8217;t actually kill the process. Neither does <tt>taskkill.exe</tt> even with the <tt>/F</tt> flag. Only a reboot seems to get rid of it. Sometimes subsequent attempts to kill it fail with a &#8220;permission denied&#8221; error.</p>
<p>When they&#8217;re hung, a backtrace from Process Explorer shows, for a 32-bit Pg running on a 64-bit host:</p>

        <p>Aggregates are also a regular source of confusion with NULLs, both in how aggregates handle NULLs on input, and when
aggregates return NULLs.  Let's look at the input case first:

                Published on <span name="publication_time">Jan 15, 2013</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Since April 2012
        <a href="http://www.vlent.nl/weblog/2012/04/27/whiskers-and-buildoutsendpickedversions/">we are using Whiskers</a>
        to store information about our Plone and Django buildouts. But when I
        moved the setup behind <span class="caps">SSL</span>, the browser started to complain about
        unsafe&nbsp;content.</p>
        <p>While I could access <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/whiskers/">Whiskers</a>
        via <strong>https</strong>://whiskers.example.com, references in the <span class="caps">HTML</span> to the
        favicon and the <span class="caps">CSS</span> were to
        <strong>http</strong>://whiskers.example.com/static/&#8230; And that either generates a
        warning about unsafe content or the browser might decide to not load
        the assets at all. And especially the missing <span class="caps">CSS</span> was severely
        endangered the&nbsp;usability.</p>
        <p>First I tried to solve this in Whiskers itself. But I soon discovered
        that the <code>master.pt</code> template in Whiskers contains several
        <a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/request.html#pyramid.request.Request.static_url">static_url</a>s,
        for&nbsp;instance:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="${request.static_url('whiskers:static/css/bootstrap.css')}" ... /&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="${request.static_url('whiskers:static/whiskers.css')}" ... /&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>And those resolved to <strong>http</strong>://whiskers.example.com/static/&#8230; so I
        had to convince Whiskers (or actually Pyramid) that we were using
        <span class="caps">SSL</span>. As a result my next attempts involved changing the Apache
        configuration. But after trying several options I could not get it
        working (possibly also due to an older version of&nbsp;Apache).</p>
        <p>So I left the configuration&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost &lt;ip&gt;:443&gt;
            ... basic stuff about the server name, logs and SSL certificates ...
        
            RewriteEngine on
            ProxyPreserveHost on
        
            # We use a custom CSS file.
            Alias /static/whiskers.css /var/www/whiskers/static/whiskers.css
            RewriteRule ^/static/whiskers.css - [L]
        
            RewriteRule ^(.*) http://127.0.0.1:6543$1 [P]
        
            &lt;Location /&gt;
                    AuthName "Whiskers"
                    AuthType Basic
                    AuthUserFile /path/to/htpasswd
                    require user spam eggs ham
            &lt;/Location&gt;
            &lt;Location /buildouts/add&gt;
                    Satisfy Any
            &lt;/Location&gt;
        &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <h3 id="waitress">Waitress</h3>
        <p>After stumbling on a link to
        <a href="https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/master/docs/index.rst#using-behind-a-reverse-proxy">a part of the Waitress documentation</a>
        I decided to try a different approach. My <code>production.ini</code> was
        basically a copy from the
        <a href="https://raw.github.com/pingviini/whiskers/master/production.ini">example on GitHub</a>
        and it contained this&nbsp;section:</p>
        <pre><code>[server:main]
        use = egg:Paste#http
        host = 0.0.0.0
        port = 6543
        </code></pre>
        <p>I installed <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/waitress/">Waitress</a> in my
        <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/">virtualenv</a> and replaced the
        above section by&nbsp;this:</p>
        <pre><code>[server:main]
        use = egg:waitress#main
        host = 0.0.0.0
        port = 6543
        url_scheme = https
        </code></pre>
        <p>And now the <span class="caps">CSS</span> is properly&nbsp;loaded!</p>
        <p>I don&#8217;t know if there are easier/better ways to solve this, but this
        works fine for&nbsp;us.</p>

We know you want to go to DjangoCon Europe but the question remains: how to convince your boss to pay for it :) We prepared some bullet points that can help with that. The key is to show your boss that this is a WIN-WIN situation for you and the company!</span></p>
<ul><li><span>You&#8217;ll meet <strong>tens of people</strong> that <strong>can</strong> help you solve </span><span class="s1">your</span><span> problems,<strong> speed up </strong></span><strong><span class="s1">your</span> processes, make you more effective</strong></li>
<li><span>You<strong> find out about new, more efficient solutions</strong> to a couple of problems that are chewing away </span><span class="s1">your</span><span> server cycles, thereby <strong>saving </strong></span><strong><span class="s1">your</span> company the need to invest in new hardware/vps/cloud</strong></li>
<li>If <span class="s1">your</span> company allow this, it&#8217;s logo can go onto the BIG <strong>WALL OF SUPPORTERS</strong>, just because they sent you to the conference. If <span class="s1">your</span> company need more visibility, we still offer sponsor packs <a href="http://2013.djangocon.eu/static/pdf/Sponsorship.pdf" target="_blank" title="here">here</a>.</li>
<li><span><strong>You get to mix with the people who are actually committing the code</strong> that gets released, have chance to talk to them, understand better the purpose of certain Django features, and find a couple of new wrinkles on </span><span class="s1">your</span><span> existing methods that will <strong>save you time</strong> on some common programming tasks.</span></li>
<li><span>You can <strong>increase </strong></span><strong><span class="s1">your</span></strong><span><strong> understanding of the code base</strong> during two days of sprinting. These people only get together as a team twice a year! This is like a <strong>free immersive technical training session</strong> that leaves you way more competent and confident at solving complex web problems with Django.</span></li>
<li><span>It&#8217;s <strong>the one, official and only Django conference in Europe</strong> where you will get expert advice from the world’s leading Django specialists. </span></li>
<li><span>Save </span><span class="s1">your</span><span> company money. This really is one of the best value conferences ever. The cost of the ticket is only 354 euro (~473$), and the conference lasts 3 days (+2 days of sprints for those who want to sprint :)</span></li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s gonna be one of a kind! In a green park full of trees, in a circus tent! In Warsaw, capital of Poland! </strong>You&#8217;ll get to relax, rest and energize for the days full of productive work as soon as you&#8217;re back in office!</li>
<li><span><strong>Poland is really cheap</strong> compared to other European countries, so the cost of your accommodation will be relatively low.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>You will have Wi-Fi connection throughout the day</strong>. You won’t need to be disconnected from the office. We take the subject of the internet connection really seriously.</span></li>
</ul><p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>We hope this post will help you. It&#8217;s probably the best moment to talk to your boss. We get a lot of emails asking when the tickets will be avaiable - don&#8217;t be late for the party! :) <br /><br />Hope to see you soon!</span></p>

        Installing PGXN on RHEL 6.3 is not as easy as it might sound.<br /><br />First you need to install the PostgreSQL yum repo:<br /><span>rpm -ivh http://yum.postgresql.org/9.2/redhat/rhel-6.3-x86_64/pgdg-redhat92-9.2-7.noarch.rpm</span><br /><br /><span>Then you need to install pgxnclient:</span><br /><span>yum install pgxnclient</span><br /><br />The pgxn client has 2 dependencies which are not listed in the package:<br /><ul><li>setuptools</li><li>simplejson 2.1</li></ul>To satisfy the first dependency we need to install python-setuptools<br />yum install python-setuptools<br /><br />The second one is not that easy as the simplejson version in RHEL6.3 is 2.0, which is too old. We can use PIP to install a newer version:<br /><span>yum remove python-simplejson</span><br /><span>yum install python-pip python-devel</span><br /><span>python-pip install simplejson</span><br /><br />And now the pgxn command will work.

        As I was looking for ways yesterday to claw back some of the cost of switching to a recursive descent parser for json, I was interested to see I could get a small but quite observable improvement simply by declaring a few hotspot functions as "inline". This means that the compiler will expand calls to them rather than generating a function call, thus saving the overhead of setting up a stack frame and doing a procedure call. The benefits of doing this vary depending on the compiler and the architecture, but it can be substantial. <br /><br />Not everything is a candidate for inlining - external functions can't be inlined because the call sites aren't available when they are compiled, and recursive functions can't either because it could cause infinite regress.<br /><br />One downside is that it can make debugging harder, so it's often best to leave inlining to late in the development process. <br /><br />Anyway, I'll probably pay rather more attention to it in future.

<p>The momentum continues as PGDay national events now expand to include the Asia Pacific region.

<p>The event has been organised thanks to Jason Godden from the Melbourne PostgreSQL Users Group and will be hosted by Experian Hitwise in St Kilda Road. It will be a special location for me as I have had the pleasure to work for Hitwise.</p>
<p>I will be presenting two talks regarding PostgreSQL. Even though the schedule has not been decided yet, my intention is to have a general talk about the PostgreSQL Project in the morning and another one about disaster recovery and high availability of Postgres databases in business critical environments.</p>

        Robert Haas wanted to know how much slower the recursive descent JSON parser would be than the explicit stack based one it's replacing. It's a reasonable question, and no doubt one close to his heart as he was the author of the original :-)<br /><br />So we need a test, and I devised one by making a single large piece of json like this: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre>create temp table myjson as <br />    select array_to_json(array_agg(q)) as jsontext <br />    from (select * from pg_class) q;<br />\copy myjson to jsontext.csv csv<br /></pre></blockquote>and a test script that looks like this:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre>create temp table myjson(j text);<br />\copy myjson from  jsontext.csv csv<br />\timing<br />do $$ declare lj text; begin select into lj j from myjson; <br />  for i in 1 .. 10000 loop perform json_in(textout(lj)); <br />  end loop; end; $$;<br /></pre></blockquote><br />(In the actual test file the last line is repeated several times).<br /><br />Robert had also pointed out that the parser was copying some strings in places where it didn't need to, and I quickly fixed that. But even after that change I was a bit dismayed to discover that there was a small but quite consistent performance degradation, So I went looking for things to tweak. It didn't take long to see that some things I had written as "if" statements repeatedly calling the routine that looks at the next look_ahead token could be much better written as a single call to that routine plus a "switch" statement.<br /><br />The test script and data files are published at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/pgdevel/downloads/jsontest.sql">https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/pgdevel/downloads/jsontest.sql</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/pgdevel/downloads/jsontext.csv">https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/pgdevel/downloads/jsontext.csv</a> The latest code with the above fixes can be pulled from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/pgdevel.git">https://bitbucket.org/adunstan/pgdevel.git</a>, and you're welcome to play along. When this is all sorted out I will publish a new patch to the mailing list. Right now I can no longer get a consistently better result using release 9.2 than I get with my code. One of my colleagues is testing on a more stable platform than I have available. But I'm quite hopeful not that at worst the performance is fairly close.

        It's my first trip to Oz!&nbsp; I will shortly be visiting Canberra and Melbourne and making a number of presentations on PostgreSQL.&nbsp; If you're an Australian PostgreSQL user, come say hello!<br /><br />First, I'll be speaking twice at LinuxConf.AU in Canberra.&nbsp; First, for the <a href="http://sysadmin.miniconf.org/">SysAdmins Miniconf</a> I'll be doing "How To Crash Your PostgreSQL Server" on January 28th.&nbsp; Then on Friday, February 1, I'll be doing "PostgreSQL 9.2: Full Throttle Database" again.<br /><br />After LCA, I will fly to Melbourne, where Experian/Hitwise will be hosting the first-ever <a href="http://2013.pgday.org.au/">Melbourne pgDay </a>on February 4.&nbsp; I'll be co-presenting there with Italian PostgreSQL hacker Gabriele Bartolini, and MelPUG leader Jason Golden. We haven't decided on talks yet for this event.<br /><br />If you've never met me or any member of the Core Team, or you have questions about PostgreSQL, or you want to get involved in the community, come to one or both of those events!&nbsp; If you're going to be in Canberra in time for Australia Day and want to bum around, I get there on the 25th.&nbsp; I could also use some recommendations on cloud hosts with a Australia data centers I can easily use for doing demos.<br /><br /><i>(Yes, I realize my blog has been nothing but events and conferences lately.&nbsp; It's that season.&nbsp; Your technical content will return eventually.) </i>

        <p>Having looked at the <a class="txt2html" href="http://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2013.html#January_11_2013">null comparisons</a>, let's see how they behave in ordering and indexing.  For ordering purposes, in a bow to
practicality, NULLs are considered to be equal to each other in terms of grouping, because, hey, if they were not, ordering them
wouldn't be very useful.

            <h2>Winds of Change</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Joaquim Rocha from Planet Django.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Jan 14, 2013</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>In my previous post I mentioned that 2013 would be a year of change. Well, here is the moment to say why that will be so: I have quit <a href="http://www.igalia.com" target="_blank">Igalia</a>.</p>
<p>Igalia is a very special company to me, I <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/2008/12/14/igalia-%C2%B7-free-software-engineering/">joined it in December 2008</a>. These were 4 intense years where I saw how the company evolved, how it moved to a cool new office, how it grew and I learned a lot in there. I had the chance to participate in several important projects like <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/2009/08/27/the-first-maemo-powered-phone/" title="The first Maemo powered phone">Maemo</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeeGo" target="_blank">Meego</a> and also to create others. I could even tell the world about them in the many <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/speaking/" target="_blank" title="Speaking">conferences</a> I spoke at and I am also proud to have accomplished things such as putting the company&#8217;s name for the first time in the highlights of online media like <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/03/igalia-releases-open-source-kinect-skeleton-tracking-library/" target="_blank">ArsTechnica</a>.</p>
<p>So the question people always ask is: <em>why did I leave!?</em><br />
As some of you may know, Igalia is organized in a flat structure where we take more responsibilities than just coding and the ultimate part of a career in the company is to become a partner. I knew this when I joined and I think this is a wonderful thing. Being at the end of my 4th year, the next stage would be to become a partner, however, for a while now I have been feeling the need of a change, of trying something different. I take my responsibilities seriously so joining as a partner would 1) only perpetuate these feelings and 2) not be fair to my colleagues. This and other factors led me to make the very difficult decision of leaving.</p>
<p><strong>The future</strong></p>
<p>My wife and I <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/2009/02/01/in-a-coruna/" title="In A Coruña">moved to A Coruña</a> (Galicia, Spain) shortly after I joined Igalia. We like the city and its people but moving is part of that change I was talking about and the truth is that we were only here for Igalia in the first place. (I will probably write a few more words about this beautiful city when we actually leave)<br />
The most difficult part of it is definitely leaving our friends. We met very nice people during these 4 years in Coruña and we consider some of them good friends rather than simply coworkers. But life is like this and I am sure we&#8217;ll stay in touch.<br />
On the other hand, the good thing of working in a Free Software company is that you can keep contributing to the projects you worked on in there if you want, so I hope I will keep doing that.</p>
<p>Since I have only started looking for a new job after I notified Igalia of my decision, I still do not know where we will move to but we are open to many places.</p>
<p>If you are interested in what I can do for your project or company, be sure to contact me through <a href="http://www.joaquimrocha.com/about/" title="About">email</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joaquimrocha" target="_blank" title="Joaquim Rocha's LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> so I can send you my CV.</p>
<p>That is all. I am already in touch with some companies so wish me luck!</p>

        <p>I need to confess something - I haven't been using PostgreSQL much over the past couple of years. Well, actually I've been using it indirectly pretty much every day, but it's been chugging along quietly in the background, storing and retrieving and otherwise manipulating data in a boringly reliable way while I've been working on Other Stuff. Every now and again I've need to interact with psql but it didn't occur to me for a long time that the output of \? has been expanded quite a bit since I last took a long careful look. In fact I might not have looked at all, but since upgrading to 9.2 I noticed that tab completion has not been converting SQL keywords to upper case like it used to, which annoys me immensely for reasons of personal aesthetics and I would like it to stop. </p>
<p>That's reason enough to take a long-ovedue look at the psql documentation , and discover not only the solution to that problem but also a couple of other useful new features I've somehow missed. (Apologies if this is old news).</p>

        Prior to PostgreSQL 9.3, trying to execute a DML on a view results in an error. The view is not able to execute directly a query to its parent table. For example, you can see this kind of behavior in 9.2. postgres=# CREATE TABLE aa (a int, b int); CREATE TABLE postgres=# CREATE VIEW aav <a href="http://michael.otacoo.com/postgresql-2/postgres-9-3-feature-highlight-auto-updatable-views/">[...]</a>

<p>(For Pyramid, see a <a class="reference external" href="http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2012/09/21/pun-pyramid.html">summary</a> of a Dutch
Python usergroup meeting talk about Pyramid.)</p>
<div class="section" id="current-situation-well-structured-collection-of-django-apps">
<h1>Current situation: well-structured collection of Django apps</h1>
<p>Well, our current system (called <a class="reference external" href="http://lizard.org">Lizard</a>) is a big
structured collection of Django apps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">&quot;Lizard-ui&quot; is an app with base python views (class based views) and base
templates for the UI and a whole bunch of css (bootstrap-based) and
javascript (jquery, openlayers, lots of extras).</p>
<p>This gives you a generic layout with a header, sidebar, the correct
colors. Lots of stuff to make it easy to quickly build your project (once
you buy into the basic structure and learn to work with it).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;Lizard-map&quot; builds upon lizard-ui and adds map views. Geographical
information. Some &quot;adapter mechanism&quot; that basically provides an interface
to connect any kind of data source to our map mechanism.</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of data sources that we've mapped to maps this
way. Rendering it, querying, returning a location's CSV data, a location's
flot/matplotlib graph, combining various data sources, etc.</p>
<p>Great to get going, but you <em>do</em> have to get to know the underdocumented
interface. And it is clunky in places.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;lizard-something&quot;. Lots of apps (40 or so) that use lizard-ui for the UI
and lizard-map for the map stuff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing: we've created 20 or 30 sites based on this structure. Mixing
various Django Lizard apps. Works like a charm.</p>
<p>Why this structure? We made it collaboratively, but there's a big piece of me
at the core. I'm used to base templates (through Plone). I'm used to lots of
python packages (so I introduced buildout/setuptools/pypi). I'm used to having
a structure to work in. Etc.</p>
<p>Why? Well, if you know &quot;belbin team roles&quot; you can <a class="reference external" href="http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2008/03/25/belbin-team-roles.html">look at mine</a>. One
of my regular roles is &quot;shaper&quot;. Melodramatically you could translate that
with &quot;Reinout, bringer of structure&quot;...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="good-points">
<h1>Good points</h1>
<p>The good things basically comes from <strong>using Django as far as possible</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A build-in admin. Handy for quickly getting an app to work, often enough for
simple admin tasks. We hardly make custom forms (apart from <tt class="docutils literal">admin.py</tt>
customizations).</li>
<li>Templates, template inheritance. Django template blocks. Everything inherits
from a base <cite>lizardbase.html</cite> which sets up a bunch of blocks and generic
layout and hooks in most of the css.</li>
<li>Views. Class based views that fill in most of the template blocks' data with
good defaults. Override what you need to, leave the rest alone. Inherit from
the base templates and you save yourself a lot of work.</li>
<li>Static data: javascript/css. Django's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/static-files/">staticfiles</a> functionality
works great. UI/map provide most of the javascript/css libraries that you
need in your project. And overriding a logo simply means placing a
<tt class="docutils literal">static/lizard_ui/logo.png</tt> in your site to override lizard-ui's default
one.</li>
<li>Django apps. In our case they're pretty much pluggable as they use the
lizard-ui/lizard-map base apps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-corresponding-drawbacks">
<h1>The corresponding drawbacks</h1>
<p>The bad and suboptimal also come from using Django as far as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">It all works because it is such a high stack. That's also the problem. You
need to buy into the whole stack and you need to work with the whole
stack. And you need to get to know the whole stack.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The code and the templates belong together. Templates have an inheritance
tree; the view code also. A template needs the view that belongs to it. A
view prepares what the template needs.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons you can develop something quickly, but it
also ties you very much to the template implementation. Doing a nice fresh
pure html+javascript interface that wants to talk to the site? You don't
know where to start. You have to buy into too much of the stack, currently.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Everything you do pulls in the whole universe. To get your app's view and
template to work, your app depends on lizard-ui and lizard-map. Which pulls
in matplotlib (for the graphs), mapnik (for custom map rendering), etc. And
a whole bunch of geo libraries. Even if you don't need them in your app.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Apart from getting the full base template and view functionality, even if
you don't need all of it, you also get a bunch of javascript/css libraries
with specific versions even if you need a slightly different one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="theoretical-interlude">
<h1>Theoretical interlude</h1>
<p>Lizard does almost everything with inheritance. Inheritance of view code and
inheritance (if you can call it that way) of templates. Django makes that easy
with class based views and with blocks in templates. At least, it looks that
way to me.</p>
<p>From reading Pyramid documentation I get the impression that <strong>composition</strong>
is a way better structuring mechanism than <strong>inheritance</strong>. I have to think
about this: would it improve Lizard's structure? It sounds <em>very</em> plausible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-the-non-django-pyramid-experiment">
<h1>Why the non-Django Pyramid experiment?</h1>
<p>Basically, the Django view/template integration we use in Lizard has been
declared dirty internally. Too integrated. Too constricting. There's no
freedom on the UI side to experiment. Everything should communicate with a
REST API. The UI should just be a static directory of html/css/javascript
files.</p>
<p>So... the drawbacks of a tightly integrated <em>view + template + static files</em>
collection of Django apps are now bigger than the gains (speed of
development/integration) we get from it. At least, those drawbacks are
internally <strong>strongly suspected</strong> to restrict us, that's why we're
experimenting.</p>
<p>A quote from <a class="reference external" href="http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2012/06/04/djangocon-keynote.html">Jacob Kaplan-Moss' keynote</a> at
last year's djangocon.eu conference serves well as an illustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Html5. Lots of enthousiasm around ajax, APIs, compatibility, css,
javascript, web sockets. Basically, the web has gone up a level. Who would
have thought three years ago that all this fun stuff is reliably possible?
The web is open again! We’re able to dream again.</p>
<p>Lots of buzzwords. Real-time. Ask beyond the hype and ask what lies behind
them. People in this case want responsive apps. More desktop-like
responsiveness. More interaction.</p>
<p>The critisism: this all is hard to do in Django. The state of the art is,
sadly, parallel MVC stacks. Django on one side, Backbone on the
other. Syncing them. “It is hard” as in “there are fundamental parts
design decisions in Django that work against it”.</p>
<p>Look at meteor to see what’s possible. Javascript-only. A couple of lines
of javascript, mongodb, etc. Lots of things you can complain about in
meteor (“callback hell”), but... just think how much effort you’d need to
expend to get it working in django! To get bi-directional sync like this
working. (The same goes for flask and all the other python web
frameworks).</p>
<p>Are we doomed to callback hell and javascript? Will everything be in
javascript? Jacob likes javascript, but he likes python much more.</p>
<p>Brainstorming, there is already something in Django. You can already push
the context a bit further down the line intead of baking it directly into
a template. Cannot we push it even further? Into the browser with some
automatic bindings? Just brainstorming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This illustrates the problem. Are we <strong>dinosaurs</strong> when using a Django
template?</p>
<p>So in the project I'm currently working on we're now doing it all new. Static
html/css/js project made by our UI expert. And he's going to define what he
needs out of the REST API.</p>
<p>Conclusion is that we no longer need templating and staticfiles on the server
side. What's left, then, of Django? ORM/models and views.</p>
<p>If we're experimenting anyway, why not write the Python part in something else
than Django? Due to my background <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/">Pyramid</a> was an easy
choice. Very small Python web framework with a solid structure and a good
extensionability story.</p>
<p>Hey, I can even use the ZODB object database. Handy, because I don't know yet
what I'll have to do for the REST API towards the javascript client. Plain
Python objects stored in that object database are easier to change.</p>
<p>And I don't need templates, just an external REST API. I'll do have to figure
out how to make a basic internal admin interface. Perhaps also some javascript
Backbone-based form? Perhaps even <a class="reference external" href="http://www.obviel.org/">Obviel</a> :-)</p>
<p>It's experiment time! (But in the end there'll have to be a new structure
again for all of our projects. Our business is not sustainable if we have to
build everything from scratch the whole time. But perhaps that
composition-instead-of-inheritance idea helps us there to set it up in a
better way.)</p>

Neste post quero destacar o <a href="http://geodjango.org/" target="_blank">GeoDjango</a>, que foi motivo de estudos e desenvolvimento nos últimos 6 meses.</p><p>Eu precisava manipular informações geográficas completas, que inclui o básico da latitude e longitude, mas também trabalhar com shapes, cálculos de área, aproximações, agrupamento de áreas, distâncias, etc. Precisava mesmo desenvolver um <abbr title="Sistema de informação geográfica/Geographic Information System"><em>SIG/GIS</em></abbr> completo e muito específico para uma demanda de projeto.</p><p>O primeiro passo foi estudar sobre <em>GIS</em>, entender alguns conceitos básicos sobre mapas, projeções e demais conceitos. Encontrei muito material pela internet, mas também comprei alguns ebooks e livros sobre o assunto. Engana-se quem pensa que <em>GIS</em> está relacionado apenas a latitude e longitude. O conceito é bem amplo e complexo, cheio de variáveis e padrões diferentes de mapas, projeções e demais utilitários que te obrigam a conhecer bem o assunto para saber como processar e organizar as informações adequadamente.</p><p>Depois de aprender bastante sobre <em>GIS</em>, o próximo passo foi encontrar tecnologias livres que atendam os pré-requisitos do projeto. Essa parte eu achei que seria difícil, mas acabou sendo uma das mais simples, pois as tecnologias que eu já trabalho no dia a dia (Python e Django) já estão preparados para <em>GIS</em>. Outra necessidade do projeto era usar um banco de dados geográfico, o mais completo das opções livres é o PostgreSQL com a extensão PostGIS. Usar um banco de dados geográfico é indispensável para aplicações <em>GIS</em>, pois existem muitos cálculos que só um banco geográfico suporta, como por exemplo, como saber em quais Estados e Municípios passa o curso de um rio? Qual a distância total do rio? Em qual Estado fica o maior techo desse rio? No PostGIS isso é possível através queries SQL que envolvem objetos geográficos.</p><p>Na comparação abaixo, é possível notar que o PostGIS é o mais completo, superando inclusive o proprietário Oracle.</p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2564"><img alt="Comparação dos bancos geográficos" class="size-full wp-image-2564 " height="781" src="http://chrblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bancos_geograficos.png" width="433" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Comparação dos bancos geográficos</p></div><h2>GeoDjango</h2><p>O GeoDjango já está embutido no Django, não é necessário instalar nada de fora, apenas habilitar algumas linhas no <em>settings.py</em>, usar o PostGIS e desenvolver normalmente, como qualquer aplicação Django. A única diferença é que o módulo permite o uso de objetos geográficos, assim é possível, via o próprio ORM do Django, realizar praticamente todos os cálculos geográficos para sua aplicação.</p><p>Além de ter toda a agilidade do ORM, ainda tem a conveniente vantagem do Admin, já pronto para ações geográficas também (e com direito a mapas)!</p><p>Vale lembrar que o GeoDjango faz apenas o trabalho de backend e todos os cálculos geográficos necessários. Não pense que basta usar o GeoDjango, importar suas informações e um mapa vai aparecer todo bonitão como num passe de mágica. É necessário fazer o trabalho do frontend e usar alguma API  (como Google Maps, OpenStreetMap ou Mapbox) para exibição dos mapas, seus contornos e pontos que serão plotados. Cada API de mapa tem sua própria documentação, mas qualquer uma pode ser utilizada em conjunto com o GeoDjango. Nesse ponto, eu gosto muito do <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers</a>, serve para agregar as mais diversas APIs de mapas, mas existem diversas outras opções. Para trabalhar com mapas, é necessário conhecer bastante JavaScript, que é a base para praticamente todas.</p><p>Concluindo, o GeoDjango é uma excelente opção para trabalhar com GIS. É uma solução livre bastante completa. O Python facilita ainda mais o trabalho, pois tem todas as bibliotecas para manipulação de shapes, como <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/" target="_blank">Python GDAL</a> que é um canivete suíço. O PostgreSQL com extensão PostGIS é a opção mais completa de banco de dados geográfico. Depois de ficar trabalhando com GeoDjango por  pelo menos 6 meses, posso afirmar que essa tecnologia foi uma das mais legais que aprendi durante 2012! Vou escrever mais a respeito e com exemplos de uso, aguardem!</p><p>O post <a href="http://christiano.me/2012/12/29/mapas-com-geodjango-e-postgis/">Mapas com GeoDjango e PostGIS</a> apareceu primeiro em <a href="http://christiano.me">Christiano Anderson</a>.</p>

        <p>Was slightly pleased to see today that nose-blockage saved our test suite. A change in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/django-browserid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">django-browserid</a> library meant that on each call to login in our test suite, it was going to make a HTTP request to <code>verifier.login.persona.org</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="https://github.com/andymckay/nose-blockage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nose-blockage</a> stops that request and 1,012 tests failed. If we didn't have that blockage in place, out test suite would have made over 1,012 HTTP requests to the persona.org server on each test run. That would have made our test suite slower and dependent on an external service. Not a big issue to fix, but this is a really good example of why nose-blockage can be useful to save you from libraries that change. Example failure:</p>

        <div class="document">
<p>I decided to make an Android app for my <a class="reference external" href="http://learnscripture.net/">Bible memory verse site</a> (created using Django). The main motivation for
the app is to get rid of the unnecessary and annoying address bars and status
bars when using the site on an Android phone. The site is already designed to
adapt to mobiles, so I'm not creating a native app — I just want a better way to
access the web app from an Android phone.</p>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="http://www.appsgeyser.com/">appsgeyser</a>, but discovered they put
adverts on your site, which I definitely don't want — this is an entirely free
app, for a free (and ad-free) site.</p>
<p>My requirements are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Full screen<ul>
<li>without any controls ever popping up, because you don't need them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Progress bar for page loading.</li>
<li>Javascript works.</li>
<li>Links work as expected.</li>
<li>Back button works like builtin browser, until you get back to the
home page, where it will cause the app to exit.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of pages and wizards with solutions for bits of these, but
putting them together turned out to be harder — for example, it seems that the
normal way of showing a progress bar for the whole window doesn't work if you've
gone full screen.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've completed the <a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.learnscripture.webviewapp">learn scripture app</a>
(ha, my first Java app!), and thought I'd share the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/net.learnscripture.webviewapp/src">complete source code</a>.</p>
<p>If you wanting a similar app, you are probably best creating your basic app
structure using a wizard, but it is helpful to see a complete solution. The
important bits are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>permissions for Internet access: <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/net.learnscripture.webviewapp/src/7161843ff07b09b85147f0416ce528ff85218f1f/AndroidManifest.xml?at=default#cl-11">AndroidManifest.xml</a></li>
<li>the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/net.learnscripture.webviewapp/src/7161843ff07b/src/net/learnscripture/webviewapp/Dashboard.java?at=default">main activity source code</a></li>

        </p>

        <div class="document">
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST framework</a> has a nice
html-based interface that, for every one of your REST views, renders the
docstring as an explanation at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Those views, they're class based views, at least the ones I use. I'm making
views that ought to be <em>base views</em> for other Django app's API. We have a
bunch of django apps for various data sources that can present their data in
more or less the same way.</p>
<p>So... I've put a decent docstring, explaining the API, in my base
views. Only... they didn't show up in the interface for the
subclasses. Apparently docstrings aren't inherited by subclasses! So I asked a
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13937500/inherit-a-parent-class-docstring-as-doc-attribute/">question on stack overflow</a>
and promptly got an answer.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing was modifying <tt class="docutils literal">.get_description()</tt>, the method Django
REST framework uses to grab and render the docstring:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import inspect  # Fancy standardlibrary Python internal inspection tool.

import docutils
from django.contrib.admindocs.utils import trim_docstring
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe

....

class MyBaseAPIView(...):

    def get_description(self, html=False):
        description = self.__doc__  # Our docstring.
        if description is None:
            # Try and grab it from our parents.
            try:
                description = next(
                    cls.__doc__ for cls in inspect.getmro(type(self))
                    if cls.__doc__ is not None)
            except StopIteration:
                pass

        description = trim_docstring(description)
        if html:
            # Render with restructured text instead of markdown.
            parts = docutils.core.publish_parts(description,
                                                writer_name='html')
            return mark_safe(parts['fragment'])
        return description
</pre>
<p>This method is a customization of Django REST framework's. There are two
changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Our parent's docstring is used if we don't have one ourselves. This makes it
easy to use a base class with proper documentation on which items to
expect. The documentation is propagated to every API that uses the base
class.</li>
<li>The docstring is parsed with restructuredtext syntax instead of markdown
(markdown is preferred by Django REST framework).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hurray for class based views!</strong> Because it is an object oriented structure,
it is easy to overwrite parts of functionality. And easy to provide methods to
actually do so (like the <tt class="docutils literal">.get_description()</tt> I modified).</p>

        After reading Ryan Bergs' "The basics of creating a tumblelog with Django" <a href="http://ryanberg.net/blog/2008/jun/24/basics-creating-tumblelog-django/">(part1)</a> and <a href="http://ryanberg.net/blog/2008/jul/2/basics-creating-tumblelog-django-part-2/">(part2)</a>, I realized that I wanted a similar tumblog/life stream but I didn't want to have to go through all the work of saving those objects to the database.  After all, isn't all that data already stored in their respective systems.  And since I am using FriendFeed, which is again duplicating all that data, I don't want to be duplicating it yet another time.
<p></p>
That's when the light bulb went off.  Using the FriendFeed API and a bit of caching I can pull in my lifestream from FriendFeed using only a custom tag.  So I came up with what I call <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/">lifefeed</a>
<p></p>
Just add "lifefeed" to your installed apps and you can now do this from any template
<div class="code"><pre>
{% load lifefeed %}{% load cache %}
{% cache 900 friendfeed %}
	{% lifefeed "YOUR FRIEND FEED USERNAME" %}
{% endcache %}
</pre></div>
You can use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/source/browse/trunk/templates/friendfeed.html">default friendfeed.html template</a> that comes with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/">lifefeed</a> or use your own.  You will most definitely want to use your own CSS to style the items since <a href="http://socialistsoftware.com/site_media/css/friendfeed.css">I am no CSS guru</a>.
<p></p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/">lifefeed</a> is very simple right now but I would like to add more to it.  Like<ul>
<li>Consolidate duplicate twitter/pownce/brightkite posts
<li>Display FriendFeed comments</li>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
To see an example of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-lifefeed/">lifefeed</a> in action check the sidebar on this page, you may have to scroll down a bit.
<p></p>
So what do you think?

        <p>Recently I wanted to try out the <a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a> commenting system on this blog.  I didn't want to lose all the comments that I had already and Intense Debate only supports importing comments from Blogger, etc but not custom blog software.  Since I wrote this blog using the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework using <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/comments">django.contrib.comments</a> I needed to come up with my own solution.</p>

<p>It only took one <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966">Tamper Data</a> request to see how an anonymous comment was posted into the Intense Debate system.  A few minutes later I had a script to import my old comments into Intense Debate.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.socialistsoftware.com/site_media/python/intenseDebate.txt">intenseDebate.py</a>
<div class="code"><pre>
import intenseDebate
intenseDebate.postComment(blogpostid="", acctid="", anonName="", anonEmail="", \
    anonURL="", comment="")
</pre></div>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>blogpostid</b> is the unique Intense Debate postId.  You can find this easily on any Intense Debate powered page using the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a> dom tab.  The key to look for is "IDCommentScript".</li>
<li><b>acctid</b> is your Intense Debate accountId.  This can also be found using the firebug dom tab.  The key to look for is "IDWUserWidget.acctid"</li>
<li><b>anonName</b> is the name of the commenter</li>
<li><b>anonEmail</b> is the commenters email address</li>
<li><b>anonURL</b> is the commenters web address</li>
<li><b>comment</b> is the text of the comment</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This method of importing comments does have it's problems.
<ol>
<li>Manual process to get the blogpostid.</li>
<li>No way of getting the Date/Time into Intense Debate.</li>
</ol>
But it's better than no comments at all.
</p>

<p>
Footnote: I don't have a problem with Django comments, especially when paired with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-comment-utils/">django-comment-utils</a>, I just wanted to give Intense Debate a try.

        This is going to be one busy weekend.  Friday after work I am going to Coors Field to watch the Rockies vs. the Devil Rays.  I am driving straight from the game to DIA to catch the red eye into Logan where I will pick up my rental car and go directly to the <a href="http://open.e-scribe.com/wiki/DjangoDotJune">Django in June</a> un-conference.
<p></p>
I am really looking forward to this.  It will be great to meet some of the great people in the Django community.  I also hope to meet some people in Boston that might be interested in helping me populate <a href="http://boston.bardiver.com/">boston.bardiver.com</a> with some more great bars.  To ensure that this happens I will also be bringing with me some <a href="http://boston.bardiver.com/blog/post/bardivercom-schwag/">BarDiver.com Schwag</a> to give out. ;)
<p></p>
Once the conference is done with I will be driving up to New Hampshire to play golf with my Dad on Fathers Day.  This should be a lot of fun.  This will be the 3rd time I have played this year.  After that and a quick visit with my Grandmother, I will be driving back into Boston to catch my flight back to Denver.

Sunday night I might actually get 8 hours of sleep before I have to be at work again on Monday morning.

        Back in September I said that I was working on a surprise project.  Well today I am happy to announce that <a href="http://bardiver.com/">BarDiver.com</a> has officially launched.  BarDiver.com is a community driven search site to help you <a href="http://bardiver.com/">find local bars</a> that have the features and atmosphere you like.
<p></p>
For this first release I am keeping BarDiver.com focused on Colorado only.  If that is a success and I get interest to open BarDiver.com for another city/state I will absolutely do that.  So please, check out the site and if you think your area could use BarDiver.com, <a href="http://bardiver.com/contact_us/">let me know</a>.
<p></p>
BarDiver.com is built using the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a>.  Django was instrumental in getting the site up fast.  I cannot get over how great Django is to work with.  I was able to use many of the goodies built into Django instead of writing them (again) myself.  Some of these things are the authentication, comments, sites, flatpages and of course the admin user interface.  I am really looking forward to the many cool new things that are being worked on in the seperate Django branches, such as <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/MultipleDatabaseSupport">Multiple Database Support</a>, and <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/GenericAuthorization">Generic Authorization</a>.
<p></p>
I hope you enjoy BarDiver.com

            <h2>Caktus Celebrates 5 Year Anniversary</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Caktus Consulting Group from Planet Django.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 12, 2012</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>Caktus celebrated the end of our fifth year in business recently. &nbsp;We threw ourselves a party and invited our local friends who helped us grow from our infancy through our awkward phases into a successful and sustainable small business.</p>
<p>We started out as four college friends moving across the country from the corn fields of Indiana to Carrboro, North Carolina to work together building awesome interactive web applications. &nbsp;We were ready to put what we had learned in school to work and continue to learn and develop new technical and business skills. Since then we've grown, steadily bringing on developers, an office manager, project managers, and a designer totaling 15 people in all. &nbsp;We were fostered locally by Carrboro Creative Coworking as a technical and creative hub for the Carrboro area and by the incredible number of local technology companies in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Research Triangle area. &nbsp;The party was to celebrate that local community, but we have made amazing connections all over the world. &nbsp;We wish everyone could have been there but had a wonderful time with those who attended while talking, reminiscing, and speculating about Caktus' future.<br />
</p>
<p>Through all of this growth and change we have maintained the core values on which Caktus was built. &nbsp;For one, we strive to foster the same feeling of camaraderie found in late night college cram sessions where teams grow together by tackling new and challenging problems. &nbsp;This is how Caktus was born and we want to continue to add brilliant people to this group while encouraging diversity within our team.<br />
</p>
<p> We also started off with a bent toward developing technical solutions to problems faced by socially responsible enterprises. &nbsp;Recently this has lead to our team members working with<a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120803-saving-a-life-in-160-characters"> UNICEF on projects</a>&nbsp;---traveling to Zambia and Malawi to work on mobile health projects.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2012/09/25/project-mwana-featured-bbc/">Our work</a>&nbsp;has been directly helpful in reducing the spread of HIV infection in these countries. &nbsp;We're grateful to have the opportunity to work with the driven folks at UNICEF and local countries to help make a difference.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have always been grateful for the teachers and encouragement that we've had along the way. &nbsp;We owe a tremendous debt to all of the communities that we are involved in. &nbsp;These include both software developer communities as well as our local North Carolina communities. &nbsp;We give back to our open source software communities by freely sharing software that we have developed as well as by sponsoring lots of technical conferences each year. &nbsp;In 2012 we sponsored: PyCon, DjangoCon, Open Data Day, and PyCarolinas (which was co-chaired by Calvin, a developer at Caktus). &nbsp;Furthermore, we have recently started focusing on giving back to local community organizations that are important to Caktus team members. So far, these have included FIRST LEGO League, Alley Cats and Angels, Orange County Rape Crisis Center, and Voices, the Chapel Hill Choir.</p>
<p> Caktus has grown from a crazy, over-caffeinated idea during a delirious late night hack session into a rock solid team of creative folks working to build web applications that make a difference and solve hard problems elegantly. &nbsp;We are all excited to grow and learn in the next five years as Caktus continues to evolve its own personality and be an active member of our local and development communities.<br />

                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 04, 2012</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>A few months ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.mechanicalgirl.com/post/open-source-contributions-come-all-shapes-and-sizes/">blog post</a> about contributing to community.  A month later, that post was republished by the folks at Red Hat, in their online magazine OpenSource.com.  When <a href="http://opensource.com/life/12/11/open-source-contributions-come-all-shapes-and-sizes">that article</a> went up, I had a chance to read through it again and realized that there were a few things I forgot the first time around.</p>

<p>In case there was any question, here's why community is so important: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/roguelynn/pycarolinas-keynote-community-ftw">Lynn Root's PyCarolinas Keynote: Community FTW</a></p>

<p>As with the first article, I'm focused on the communities in which I am actively involved - Django and Python - but I'm convinced that these suggestions apply to just about any open source community.  On that note, here are some additional things you can do if you want to give back to open source:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Answer questions in user groups.</b>  The two most active user groups in the Python world are probably <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/django-users">Django users</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</a>.  Yes, sometimes the same questions seem to be asked over and over again, but there are always people new to the language or framework who need help finding their way - be a pal and help them find answers.</li>
<br />
<li><b>Answer questions on StackOverflow.</b>  StackOverflow has channels for both <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python">Python</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/django">Django</a>.  Maybe in the course of reading through the questions other users pose, you'll find that weird use case that you had to deal with once - maybe the solution you came up will help someone else.  Check in periodically, or just subscribe to the feeds (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=django&amp;sort=newest">Django</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=python&amp;sort=newest">Python</a>) to get the latest questions.  (And if you are looking to contribute in some other language, operating system, database, etc. check out SO's main tags page - there's a plethora of channels to choose from: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags">http://stackoverflow.com/tags</a>.)</li>
<br />
<li><b>Answer questions on Reddit.</b>  That's right - Reddit has very active <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/python">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/django">Django</a> channels as well.</li>
<br />
<li><b>Get involved in discussions on IRC.</b>  A couple of active channels to join on freenode are: #django, #python, and #pyladies.  I also hang out in #postgresql from time to time.  There are always new people coming in looking for help.  If you're not that familiar with how IRC works, or you need a quick refresher, there's a great set of instructions on the PyLadies site: <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/chat/irc-instructions/">IRC Instructions</a></li>
<br />
<li><b>Volunteer to help a new speaker.</b> Have you done any conference speaking in the past?  Are you a seasoned pro by now?  If so, you can volunteer to mentor other developers who are just getting started.  Help them through the process of drafting a talk proposal, give them your best advice on putting together slides, and by all means, if you've figured out how to manage stage fright, make with the tips!  There's a new community in town - <a href="http://speakup.io/">speakup.io/</a> - where you can create a bio, join a mailing list, and partner up with someone who needs your guidance.</li>
<br />
<li><b>Meet other programmers face to face!</b> I mentioned this in the last post, but it bears repeating.  Probably the most effective way to give back to the community is to get involved on a personal level.  Volunteer to help teach a class through groups like <a href="http://codescouts.org/">Code Scouts</a>, <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">GirlDevelopIt</a>, <a href="http://pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/events/93217172/">Women Who Code</a>.  Find a local meetup and offer to give a talk.  If your town doesn't have a Python, Django, or other meetup group, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/create/">start one</a>!  And keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=hackathon&amp;radius=Infinity">hackathons</a>! (An interesting one that popped up on my radar a few weeks ago: <a href="http://montrealpython.org/2012/11/hackons-corruption/">Call to citizens to fight against government corruption!</a>, hosted by Montreal Python)</li>
<br />
<li><b>Attend conferences.</b>  In my world, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US</a> and <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US</a> are the two big events of the year.  In some cases, those two conferences are the only annual opportunities I have to spend time with friends from across the globe.  Aside from that, they present some great learning opportunities - just take a look at the recently announced PyCon US talk schedule for 2013: <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/lists/talks/">https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/lists/talks/</a>.  But yes, those big conferences can also be expensive and hard to get to.  Luckily there are also smaller regional conferences in the US, such as <a href="http://blog.pycarolinas.org/">PyCarolinas</a>, <a href="http://www.pyarkansas.org/">PyArkansas</a>, and <a href="http://pyohio.org/">PyOhio</a>.  And if you happen not to be in the US and don't want to travel here, there are also a few dozen international Python conferences - a complete list can be found at <a href="http://www.pycon.org/">www.pycon.org</a>.  And let's not forget <a href="http://2013.djangocon.eu/">Euro DjangoCon</a>, to be held next year in Warsaw, Poland.  If you're not at all interested in Python or Django conferences, congratulations on making it this far - for you I have: <a href="http://www.djangrrl.com/feeds/django/www.railsconf.com">RailsConf</a>, <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">OS Bridge</a>, <a href="http://www.oscon.com">OSCON</a>, a host of <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a> and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/topics/nodejs/">JavaScript</a> events, and <a href="http://postgresopen.org/">Postgres Open</a>, just to name a few.  Go.  It'll change your life, swear to God.  (Apologies for the reference to my favorite surfing movie - double points if you can guess what it is.)</li>

                  By Reinout van Rees from Planet Django.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 04, 2012</span>.
            
        </p>

        <div class="document">
<p>We used <a class="reference external" href="http://django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST framework</a> for a
while now. Nothing spectacular yet. In most cases we're only <em>returning</em> a bit
of JSON. We chose Django REST framework over Piston because that one was
effectively unmaintained at the time. We chose it over <a class="reference external" href="http://tastypieapi.org/">tastypie</a> because of the great way in which Django REST
framework presents your API in the browser (the &quot;browseable API&quot; they call
it), which is very helpful if you want others to actually <em>use</em> your API!</p>
<p>And... Django REST framework uses Django's class based views, which we're
using a lot. So it matches the style we want to work with. This was a second
thing that gave it an edge over tastypie for us.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, most of our Django REST framework 0.3.3 (or 0.4 or whatever)
views looked like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from djangorestframework.views import View as JsonView


class SomeView(JsonView):

    def get(self, request):
        return {'some': 'dictionary',
                'or': ['a', 'list']}
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">JsonView</tt> would take care of converting everything that came in/out of the
<tt class="docutils literal">get()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">post()</tt> between JSON and whatever Python data structure it
represents. Handy.</p>
<p>Since 30 october, <a class="reference external" href="http://django-rest-framework.org/topics/rest-framework-2-announcement.html">version 2.0 is out</a>. Lots
of improvements and, from what I read, a better fit for many projects. But,
boy, is it <strong>backward incompatible</strong>. I thought to do a quick migration...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All the imports have changed from <tt class="docutils literal">import djangorestframework</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">import
rest_framework</tt>. Well, that's a sure fire way to make absolutely sure
nobody accidentally uses the wrong version.</li>
<li>Hey, my <tt class="docutils literal">JsonView</tt> is gone! You cannot just spit out a dict or list
anymore in your <tt class="docutils literal">.get()</tt> and get it converted automatically. You must
wrap it in a special <tt class="docutils literal">Response</tt> object. This is probably needed, but it
doesn't look as nice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what the first example looks like in version 2.0:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response as RestResponse


class SomeView(APIView):

    def get(self, request):
        return RestResponse({'some': 'dictionary',
                             'or': ['a', 'list']})
</pre>
<p>It works fine, but it lost a bit of its friendliness, at least for such an
utterly simple example. I looked at the documentation, though, and everything
is as simple as <tt class="docutils literal">JsonView</tt> used to be if you work with models. Just two or
three lines of code for basic cases and you're done.</p>
<p>I'll have to go through some other apps we made, as <em>everything</em> that uses
Django REST framework has to change at the same time. Every single
app. There's no in-between. I'm afraid it'll be quite a headache...</p>

<p>I've got a <a class="reference external" href="http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2012/04/07/standing-desk.html">standing desk at home</a> that I
quite like. So I thought &quot;why not also try it at the office?&quot;.</p>
<a href="http://photos.reinout.vanrees.org/Grok-zope-plone-python/nelen-schuurmans/11586589_bzdfkF#!i=2250838886&amp;k=5DwFsM8&amp;lb=1&amp;s=A" title="Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug"><img alt="Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug" src="http://photos.reinout.vanrees.org/Grok-zope-plone-python/nelen-schuurmans/i-5DwFsM8/0/M/IMG_1801-M.jpg" title="Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug" /></a><p>My poor desk is now lacking four screws: every leg is only using one screw
for the very last hole in the legs. Stable enough for a temporary test, but
not something that I want all the time. So I'll have to find longer legs or a
different desk. And it'll have to be some 5 cm higher, too.</p>
<p>The main difference with my home desk is the amount of time I spend behind it:
a full 8 hour working day (instead of a couple of hours in the evening at
home). I've been at it for a few days now and it works out quite fine. Some
quick observations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I walk around a lot more. If I want to ask something of someone sitting two
desks away I'll just walk over instead of talking to him while sitting in my
chair.</li>
<li>I feel active at the end of the day! A bit tired in my legs, but I feel at
least 2 cm taller.</li>
<li>Discussing with a colleague often means sitting down for a minute (=getting
a rest). An extra benefit of interacting with my colleagues :-)</li>
<li>I might have to get a mat or something to place under my feet, as the floor
is quite hard. I don't know whether that'll help, but apparently many people
use that when standing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... I'll keep up the experiment for a while to see whether I really like
it. At the moment my guess is that I'll convert to standing-desk-only.</p>

                  By Reinout van Rees from Planet Django.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Dec 01, 2012</span>.
            
        </p>

        <div class="document">
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ext/intersphinx.html">Intersphinx</a>
is a very neat way to point at other projects' documentation from within your
own. Handy if you want to reference a Python module or an official Django
setting or class.</p>
<p>You have to do some setup work, like enabling the intersphinx extension. Most
of the time, your automatically generated sphinx configuration will already
have it enabled out of the box. Now you need pointers at the other projects'
documentation (there needs to be a special <tt class="docutils literal">objects.inv</tt> file with link
target definitions). At the end of your file, add something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
intersphinx_mapping = {
    'python': ('http://python.readthedocs.org/en/v2.7.2/', None),
    'django': ('http://django.readthedocs.org/en/latest/', None),
    'sphinx': ('http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/', None),
    }
</pre>
<p>Now you can do fun stuff like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Django knows about your URL configuration because you told it
where to find it with the :django:setting:`ROOT_URLCONF` setting.
</pre>
<p>Only... I got an error:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role &quot;django:setting&quot;.
</pre>
<p>What? I couldn't figure it out and asked a <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13387125/how-to-link-with-intersphinx-to-django-specific-constructs-like-settings">question on stackoverflow</a>. I
got some tips, but couldn't get it to work.</p>
<p>Then I got an idea. Sphinx has a lot of things build in, but not Django's
custom Sphinx roles like <tt class="docutils literal">setting</tt>! That's not a standard Sphinx
one. Perhaps you need to copy/paste the other project's custom sphinx
extensions to get it to work? Not terriby elegant, but worth a shot.</p>
<p>In the end I <strong>got it working</strong> by copying a small snippet from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/docs/_ext/djangodocs.py">Django's
sphinx extension</a> as
<tt class="docutils literal">_ext/djangodocs.py</tt> next to my documentation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def setup(app):
    app.add_crossref_type(
        directivename = &quot;setting&quot;,
        rolename = &quot;setting&quot;,
        indextemplate = &quot;pair: %s; setting&quot;,
    )
</pre>
<p>And I added the following to my Sphinx' <cite>conf.py</cite>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import os
import sys

...

sys.path.append(
    os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), &quot;_ext&quot;)))
# ^^^ I'll do that neater later on.

extensions = ['djangodocs',
              # ^^^ I added that one.
              'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
              ...
              ]

...
</pre>
<p>And... Yes, it worked!</p>
<p>So: <strong>intersphinx works, but if you point at a custom role, you need to have that custom role defined locally</strong>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you create the best software when you are frustrated with the status quo and have an itch to scratch. <a href="http://toastdriven.com/">Daniel Lindsley's</a>  <a href="http://haystacksearch.org/">Haystack</a> and <a href="http://tastypieapi.org/">Tastypie</a> are classic examples of scratching your own itch. He had a problem to solve and none of the existing solutions were good enough, so he built his own, and in doing so, came up with a solution that solves other people's problems too.</p>
<p>Those of you who have been attending the Django Boston meetup events may remember that we had Daniel come and speak at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/50213312/">Django Boston meetup in February 2012</a>. I was unable to attend that meetup, but at the <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/sprints/">DjangoCon 2012 sprint</a> in September, I got the chance to sit down with him, and talk with him about how he came to build Haystack and Tastypie, two of the most popular add-ons for Django. Check out <a href="https://crate.io/packages/django-haystack/">Haystack</a> and <a href="https://crate.io/packages/django-tastypie/">Tastypie</a> on crate.io to see their activity.</p>
<p>Here is the full-length video from that interview:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this interview, we talk about:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>How Daniel got started building Haystack and Tastypie - what was the impetus</strong>?</li>
<li><strong>What is the best use of Haystack?</strong>  (NASA uses it for a couple of their sites)</li>
<li><strong>How are people using Tastypie?</strong> (lots of mobile, crate.io has one consistent API that serves both public as well as site itself)</li>
<li><strong>What are the challenges of maintaining an open source project?</strong>  (Expectations for commercial grade support, availability, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>What do you like about the Django sprints?</strong> (Camaraderie and dedicated time to fix things. Getting in person time with people you don't usually get to work with)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>My favorite quote from the interview:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>"I produce open source software (OSS) because my life has been possible because of OSS. These tools affect my every day life. I've gotten so much from open source, it feels like the only right thing to do is give back to OSS." <br />   -Daniel Lindsley</div>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By Adrian Holovaty from Planet Django.

        </p>

        <p><p>Last week, I launched <a href="http://www.soundslice.com/">Soundslice</a>. <a href="http://www.soundslice.com/about/">The about page</a> has the scoop, but here's a separate post with some personal details.</p>

<p><strong>What is Soundslice?</strong> At face value, it's a site that syncs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_tablature#Guitar_tablature">guitar tablature</a> with YouTube videos. Beyond face value, it's a site that lets you annotate sound.</p>

<p>As somebody who's never learned to read music, I rely on "tabs" for learning new songs and preserving my own learnings when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(music)">transcribing music</a>. The problem with tabs, though, is that while they're <em>awesome</em> for notating what strings/frets to play on a guitar, they're <em>horrible</em> for notating subtleties of music, such as how long to hold a note, or phrasing, or really anything beyond the physicality of "put your finger on the fifth fret, second string." I'd spend hours transcribing a guitar solo, then I'd preserve my learnings in guitar tab, only to come back to it a few days later completely befuddled and needing to listen to the original recording again.</p>

<p>They're also horrible because they're generally ASCII text files (<a href="http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/l/led_zeppelin/stairway_to_heaven_tab.htm" rel="nofollow">example</a>). <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adrian_h/6980408585/">C'mon</a>, people, it's 2012. There <em>are</em> apps and sites that "play" tab as MIDI, but I've never found those compelling. Learning guitar from MIDI is great, if you want your playing to sound robotic.</p>

<p><strong>Several years ago,</strong> I realized I wanted a tool that let me combine tabs with an actual audio recording. This would give me the best of both worlds: the specific instructions in a tab, plus the crucial element of being able to listen to the <em>original musician</em> play it. (As somebody from the rock/pop and jazz worlds, I believe in learning by listening, instead of rote learning from sheet music.)</p>

<p>I started building this tool in late 2009, at night and on weekends, off and on (mostly off). The original version was a Flash application that let you upload MP3s and gave you an interface to annotate them; I learned Actionscript to do it, and I would joke with friends that I would be the last person in the history of mankind to <em>start</em> learning Flash. (This was around the time of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Steve Jobs Flash memo</a>.) Why Flash? Because I wanted to build an audio app in the browser, and Flash was the only realistic solution at the time.</p>

<p>I had a pretty cool site working by summer 2010, with some musician friends using it, but it had some big problems: Flash was dying, for one, and there were major copyright issues with the fact that people could upload and share arbitrary MP3s.</p>

<p>I started building an HTML5 version to address the Flash issue, but I quickly ran into issues with non-standard Web audio specs. (Since then, the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">Web Audio API</a> has caught steam, although it'll be a while before it's supported enough to be considered mainstream.)</p>

<p>That's when I got the idea to orient the whole thing around YouTube -- and, more broadly, <em>player APIs</em> -- instead of audio files. This avoided the copyright issue of allowing people to upload and share arbitrary files, it offloaded the playing-music-in-a-browser technology to YouTube, and it nicely fit the trend of amateur musicians learning from YouTube videos.</p>

<p>So I rewrote the whole thing <em>again</em> in JavaScript / HTML5, using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference">YouTube JavaScript API</a>, and although I had to leave behind some features of the old app (arbitrary slowdown speed, waveform display, "perfectly" tight looping), it immediately felt right.</p>

<p>I asked my friend (and <a href="http://www.everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</a> colleague) <a href="http://pjmacklin.com/">PJ Macklin</a> if he wanted to design it, and he immediately pitched in, in his spare time, to make it look and act beautifully. This guy is really good.</p>

<p>Some more random notes...</p>

<p><strong>Beyond face value,</strong> Soundslice is a way of annotating sound. At the moment, it only works on YouTube videos, and the marketing copy focuses on guitar tabs. But really, it's a general-purpose audio/video annotator. (See <a href="http://www.soundslice.com/yt/gx8qTxlFXRY/">my annotation of DjangoCon lightning talks</a>, for example.) I decided to focus on guitar tabs because it was much more easily understood -- but I hope people use it for much more than that, inventing uses I never would have thought of.</p>

<p><strong>Everybody's noticed</strong> how shiny and polished Soundslice is, even in its first version. That's deliberate. I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">Lean Startup</a> concept of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a>, but for something like Soundslice, the minimum viable product needs to be really well-done. I'd say 80% of the positive feedback we've gotten is directly related to the fact that it's so polished. If it were a half-baked product with a lousy UI, people just wouldn't have liked it as much. For some class of product, my dear Lean Startuppers, good design and polish in your first version matters.</p>

<p><strong>This is the most app-like thing I've ever made</strong>, with tons of keyboard shortcuts, UI/UX details and very little traditional page-by-page Web navigation. It's been a ton of fun to work on something completely different from what I've traditionally built.</p>

<p><strong>Is Soundslice a startup or a side project?</strong> I incorporated it a while ago, so it's definitely a company -- but, until just after launch, I didn't have a good answer to the more philosophical version of that question. My main concern was that it was too niche to be a sustainable business. But after seeing the near-unanimous positive feedback, I am 100% convinced it's a worthwhile product and nice market. There are a bunch of opportunities for "Pro" accounts and partnering with content providers, for example. And if you know anybody who runs a music-education site, please put me in touch: I want to talk to them about licensing the technology.</p>

<p><strong>When we launched the other day</strong> (on Nov. 15), I nearly cried. The feedback we've gotten has been the best, most positive feedback I've ever gotten on <em>any</em> product I've ever built, in 14 years of doing Web stuff. People <em>love</em> this thing. And I'd been working on it for so long that it had risked becoming my joke project -- the one that you work on forever but never actually launch. Seeing people's reactions made me emotional.</p>

<p>Thank you to everybody who's checked it out, created an account, annotated videos and spread the word. This is just the beginning. We've been fixing things and adding new features <a href="http://www.soundslice.com/changelog/">every single day</a> since launch, with no sign of stopping. <a href="https://twitter.com/soundslice">Follow us on Twitter</a>, and please help spread the word. More awesomeness is on the way!</p></p>

        <p>Austin, Texas, known for its live music scene and hosting of the annual music and technology festival SXSW, is also home to a vibrant startup and programming community.</p>

<p>Local Pythonistas are numerous enough to justify two separate meetup groups - one focused on web development, and a second centered around science and academia.</p>

<p>Women are also well-represented, with a local <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/chapters/austin">GirlDevelopIt</a> chapter (led by <a href="https://twitter.com/garannm">Garann Means</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsATX">Rails Girls ATX</a>, and a monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Austin-All-Girl-Hack-Night/">all-girl hack night</a>.</p>

<p>And now we have PyLadies, here to represent the women of Austin's Python community.  The aim of PyLadies ATX, organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/bshaurette">Barbara Shaurette</a>, is to help female Python developers (from aspiring to experienced) to grow in their careers in technology.  In addition to working with local programmers, we're also planning to reach out to women in computer science programs at local colleges (such as the University of Texas) and eventually on outreach to computer science teachers in the area.  As with other PyLadies chapters around the nation, the Austin group will support women through a combination of teaching/learning and social space.</p>

<p>The first PyLadies ATX meetup will take place after the hustle and bustle of the holidays has passed - look for an announcement for mid-January.</p>

<p>For more information, check out the meetup page at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-ATX/">http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-ATX/</a>, and follow on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/PyLadiesATX">https://twitter.com/PyLadiesATX</a>.</p>

            <h2>DjangoCon open for speakers!</h2>
        </a>

        <p class="discreet">
            
                  By DjangoCon Europe from Planet Django.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Nov 26, 2012</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p><span>We’re very pleased to invite all members of the Django community to submit their talk proposals for DjangoCon Europe 2013. <strong>We’re looking for Django and Python enthusiasts, pioneers, adventurers and anyone else who would like to share their Django achievements and experiments with the rest of the community.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This Call for Papers closes on January 8th 2013 at midnight CET.</span></p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p><span>Submit your proposal by <strong><a href="http://time.is/compare/2359_08_Jan_2013_in_Warsaw">January 8th, 23:59:59 CET</a>.</strong> No late submissions, no excuses.</span></p>
<p><span>All talks need to be <strong>in English</strong>. Don’t worry if you think your English isn’t good enough; as long as you can be understood, that’s really good enough.</span></p>
<p><span><strong> Most talks will be 30 minutes long</strong> (we may get in touch to ask if you’d like to speak for longer), <em>including time for questions and answers</em>. Our tight schedule means we’ll need to enforce the time limit rigorously, so we suggest timing your presentation in advance. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Make sure you care</strong>, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal more difficult. If your proposal is hard to read or understand, that will definitely count against it. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Don’t overdo it</strong> either. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, you need to slim things down. We’ll get a large number of submissions, so the quicker you can to make a good impression, the better. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>We favour original content</strong>. If you want to discuss something that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, or new research, or development - something the community won’t have heard already. Of course, if your talk is plain awesome as-is, go for that! </span></p>
<h3>The Selection Process</h3>
<p><span>We’re expecting many (70-150) excellent proposals, and we have around 20 speaking slots. The process we’ll use to help us select the most appropriate ones for the event is roughly this: </span></p>
<ul><li>Anonymise submissions, to eliminate bias. </li>
<li>The first round of voting is yours: we invite Django community to rate anonymised topics on a scientific 3-point scale (“meh”, “yay”, “MUST HAVE”). </li>
<li>De-anonymise for the final selection. </li>
</ul><h3>Speakers’ Perks</h3>
<p>If you’re selected as a speaker, here’s what you’ll get:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Entrance to the conference.</strong> The first batch of tickets may be gone before we announce the speakers, so it would be wise to purchase your ticket anyway. If you are selected to speak, and if you need to, we can refund the price of your ticket (but if you don’t, we can spend more money on making the conference more awesome!).</li>
<li><strong>Accommodation in Warsaw</strong> in a fancy hotel (with free WiFi, of course) near the venue for the days of the conference and a day before and after (i.e. May 14th-20th). If your employer or sponsor covers your accommodation, we’ll be pleased to advertise them as a sponsor of the conference. The money we save will be used to make the event even more awesome (you might see a pattern here …). </li>
<li>An <strong>awesome speaker’s bag</strong> with local goodies, just to say a little thank-you from all the Django community. <br /> </li>
</ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>if</em> we are able to, we will cover the cost of speakers’ travel. We can’t promise anything at this stage, but as we get closer to the date, if we are able to offer our speakers a nice surprise, we will.</p>
<p>If you know you won’t be able to afford the cost of travel to Warsaw, please make that clear in your submission. <strong>It won’t affect your chances</strong> of selection but it will give us an idea of how many speakers are in that situation.</p>
<h3>We Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-shows. Not everybody is a live-demo-god. Not everybody even knows they have something great to talk about - yet.</p>
<p>So, there might be a million reasons why you don’t consider yourself a potential speaker at DjangoCon Europe, where all your heroes have spoken in the past. <strong>We’d like to change your mind about that. </strong></p>
<p>If you think you have something that would be worth sharing, we are here to reach out and help you develop or hone the skills you think you need to deliver a great presentation on the subject.</p>
<ul><li>We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding. </li>
<li>We can put you in touch with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission, or you can refer to the “Example Submission” section below for tips. </li>
<li>We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. </li>
<li>If you need practice giving talks, get in touch; we can hook you up with a local group or set up a stage for you and a bunch of friends in advance, so you can practise in front of a friendly crowd. </li>
<li>We can arrange a rehearsal evening the day before the conference to help you feel better in our amazing circus. </li>
<li>If you are worried that your English is not fluent enough, we can put you in touch with a native English speaker, who can look over your proposal, talk or slides, make suggestions, corrections and improvements, and generally help you feel confident that you’ll be able to express yourself clearly and effectively to the audience. </li>
<li>Again, <em>whatever</em> else you might need, we’re here to help. </li>
</ul><p>So get in touch: <a href="mailto:hello@djangocircus.com" title="hello@djangocircus.com">hello@djangocircus.com</a> (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).</p>
<h3>Example Submission</h3>
<p>If you need inspiration, take a look on one of the submission from the previous year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Topic: I hate your database</strong></p>
<p>After years of working with all sorts of databases and wrangling with South to support just five of them, I take a look at databases (relational, document, key-value and more) and at some of the problems that Django programmers often come across with them.<br />The talk will cover (among other things) the disadvantages of relational databases, why &#8220;NoSQL&#8221; isn&#8217;t always the answer, the pains of storing geographic data, a small amount of database theory, and the very small number of good things about MySQL. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>One more thing&#8230;</h3>
<p>Diversity. As part of the Django community, we share its commitment to diversity, openness and inclusivity. Diversity is a difficult ideal to achieve, particularly at a technology conference, but we are aware of the challenges and promise to do our best to work towards the ideal.</p>
<p>We have <a href="http://2013.djangocon.eu/codeofconduct/" title="Code of conduct">adopted the PyCon Code of Conduct</a> as a model for this event, and we expect all attendees to abide by it and respect its principles. With a <a href="http://2013.djangocon.eu/team/" title="Team">team like this</a> and the support of the community, we can’t fail to make DjangoCon Europe 2013 an event that all Djangonauts can participate in and enjoy, can we?</p>
<h3>Submit Your Talk</h3>
<p>Congratulations if you’ve reached this far. Now go ahead and submit your talk:</p>

        </p>

        <p>I got a somewhat unique request on a project the other day. My client has a lead tracking system where his salesman input leads and often upload scanned documents to include with the leads. I implemented this all with standard Django forms and a formset wizard to input multiple files.</p>
<p>My client was worried that a lot of images would be uploaded and he would have to start paying extra for storage. He asked if I could compress images on upload to save space. After searching the web I found examples of a few different ways of doing it. But after reading about <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/file-uploads/?from=olddocs#upload-handlers">Upload Handlers in the Django docs</a>, this seemed like it would be the best method for accomplishing this so I wouldn&#8217;t have to modify my models or forms at all. Unfortunately for me, it didn&#8217;t go as straightforward as I had hoped. I couldn&#8217;t find a good example of someone else doing this sort of thing and it took me MUCH longer than the 30-45 minutes I had planned for.</p>
<p>The good news is that I figured it out so I&#8217;m posting it here for all to benefit hopefully.</p>
<p>I created a file named uploadhandlers.py in my app and added the following code:</p>

<p>You can see from the code that I am simply extending the MemoryFileUploadHandler, which is one of the Django default upload handlers. I&#8217;m overriding the file_complete function to change the size and jpeg quality &#8211; which are settings in my settings file.</p>
<p>To implement the change, I update my views. The view that contains the form has to be csrf_exempt, and the view handling the uploads switches to this upload handler on the fly with the following code:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre class="python">request.<span>upload_handlers</span>.<span>insert</span><span>&#40;</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> CompressImageUploadHandler<span>&#40;</span><span>&#41;</span><span>&#41;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>

        <p>If you've been following this blog, you'll know that <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blog/django-deployment-using-paas/">I'm a big fan of PaaS providers</a> - heck, I even built <a href="http://kencochrane.net/blog/2011/06/djangozoom-com-review/">one</a> which gave me even greater respect for all the work that goes into making a platform that is flexible, scalable, reliable and easy to use.</p>
<p>During the last few weeks I've been kicking the tires on these PaaS solutions, both publicly hosted ones like Heroku and Dotcloud as well as open source ones like OpenShift and CloudFoundry.</p>
<p>Last night I gave a talk <a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/68186952/">Django deployment revisited</a> at the Django Boston meetup group, and discussed four different PaaS providers: Stackato, Dotcloud, OpenShift and Heroku. As an example, I showed for each provider how to deploy <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blog/mezzanine-a-django-based-alternative-to-wordpress/">Mezzanine</a>, a Django-based blogging and CMS software.</p>
<p>Here are the slides from the presentation (sorry, no audio):</p>
<p></p>
<div><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/appsembler/django-deployment-revisited" target="_blank" title="Django deployment with PaaS">Django deployment with PaaS</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/appsembler" target="_blank">Appsembler</a></strong></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Show me the code!</h3>
<p>All the code used in the examples is available in this <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/">paasbakeoff</a> Github repo - with <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/network">a different branch</a> for each PaaS provider.</p>
<p>One criteria for a PaaS is how many files do I need to add/modify in order to get my Django project deployed. What became apparent as I was giving the talk, is that all of the providers function quite similarly in regards to how you get your Django project working with them.  It really boils down to these things:</p>
<h3>DATABASES</h3>
<p>All of the providers will provision a PostgreSQL or MySQL (except for Heroku) database for you without you needing to do anything except issue one command.</p>
<p>The actual database creation happens automatically except for Dotcloud in which you get to specify the name of the database in your settings.py, and you have complete control about how it's created in a createdb.py script. You can either see this as an advantage (complete flexibility) or a disadvantage (one more thing to have to manage). It's the classic tradeoff - control. vs ease-of-use, that is a recurring theme when adopting a PaaS solution.</p>
<p>The way you tell Django to use this provisioned database, is to modify your settings.py file (or use a separate production_settings.py) to override the DATABASES setting. All of the providers expose environment variables that contain the connection string:</p>
<h4>Stackato</h4>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">DATABASE_URL</pre>
<p>You can also use VCAP_SERVICES to retain <a href="http://core.cloudfoundry.org/">CloudFoundry Core</a> compatibility.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<h4>OpenShift</h4>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL
OPENSHIFT_POSTGRESQL_DB_URL
</pre>
<h4>DotCloud</h4>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">DOTCLOUD_DB_SQL_LOGIN
DOTCLOUD_DB_SQL_PASSWORD
DOTCLOUD_DB_SQL_HOST
DOTCLOUD_DB_SQL_PORT</pre>
<h4>Heroku</h4>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">DATABASE_URL</pre>
<p>Also see the convenient <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dj-database-url">dj-database-url</a> package by Kenneth Reitz for handling the parsing of the DATABASE_URL string with one line of code.</p>
<p>Heroku lets you attach multiple PostgreSQL databases (master/slave, or staging/production) and each database gets it's own color-coded database URL (i.e. HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_GREEN, HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_RED, etc.)  Most Django projects are only going to use 1 database, so Heroku provides a pg:promote command that lets you promote that database to be the canonical DATABASE_URL.</p>
<h3>STATIC_ROOT</h3>
<p>While it's possible to have Django serve up static assets (images, CSS, Javascript), it's advised that all static assets should be served up using an HTTP server like Apache or Nginx for performance reasons. All of the PaaS providers have a built-in way to do this except for Heroku which requires that you serve them up using Amazon S3.</p>
<h4>Stackato</h4>
<p>Stackato strangely <a href="http://docs.stackato.com/deploy/languages/python/index.html#uwsgi-python-static-files">uses uWSGI to serve the static assets</a>. In the stackato.yml file:</p>
<pre class="brush: yaml; gutter: false;">processes:
    web: $STACKATO_UWSGI --static-map /static=$HOME/mywebsite/static</pre>
<h4>OpenShift</h4>
<p><strong></strong>In the settings.py file:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'), 'wsgi', 'static')</pre>
<p>In /wsgi/static/.htaccess:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^application/static/(.+)$ /static/$1 [L]</pre>
<h4>Dotcloud</h4>
<p><strong></strong>In settings.py:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">STATIC_ROOT = '/home/dotcloud/volatile/static/'</pre>
<p>In nginx.conf:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">location /static/ { root /home/dotcloud/volatile ; }</pre>
<h4>Heroku</h4>
<p><strong></strong>In settings.py:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage'</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/heroku/mywebsite/settings.py#L369">complete example of S3FileStorage</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MEDIA_ROOT</h3>
<p>Similar to the STATIC_ROOT, the files in MEDIA_ROOT need to not only be served up Apache, Nginx or uWSGI, but also need to be persisted across subsequent deploys. By default, files that are uploaded through your Django application will be stored in the application container that is thrown away on every deploy. So we need to tell Django to store these files in a data directory that won't be discarded.</p>
<h4>Stackato</h4>
<p>You first need to create a 'filesystem' service by adding it to your stackato.yml file:</p>
<pre class="brush: yaml">services:
    postgresql-mywebsite: postgresql
    filesystem-mywebsite: filesystem
</pre>
<p>Then in your settings.py:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">MEDIA_ROOT = os.environ['STACKATO_FILESYSTEM']
</pre>
<h4>OpenShift</h4>
<p>OpenShift provides a persisted data dir that can be referenced with the environment variable OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR'), 'media')
</pre>
<p> You then need to symlink this directory to the static directory that is being served up by Apache (see above in STATIC_ROOT).</p>
<p>In .openshift/action_hooks/build:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -d $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/media ]; then
    mkdir $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/media
fi

ln -sf $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/media $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/wsgi/static/media
</pre>
<h4>Dotcloud</h4>
<p>Add the following to your settings.py:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">MEDIA_ROOT = '/home/dotcloud/data/media/'</pre>
<p>Add another line to your nginx.conf:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">location /static/ { root /home/dotcloud/volatile; }
location /media/ { root /home/dotcloud/data/media; }
</pre>
<h4>Heroku</h4>
<p>In settings.py:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; gutter: false;">DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage'</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/heroku/mywebsite/settings.py#L369">complete example of S3FileStorage</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WSGI</h3>
<p>The PaaS providers use mod_wsgi, uWSGI or Gunicorn to serve the Django application.</p>
<h4>Stackato</h4>
<p>Stackato uses uWSGI by default but you can <a href="http://docs.stackato.com/deploy/languages/python/index.html#using-a-custom-web-server">use gunicorn instead</a> if you prefer. You simply place a <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/stackato/wsgi.py">wsgi.py</a> file that references our Django settings file.</p>
<h4>OpenShift</h4>
<p>OpenShift uses mod_wsgi and expects to find a file /wsgi/application that <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/openshift/wsgi/application">looks something like this</a>. </p>
<h4>Dotcloud</h4>
<p>Like Stackato, Dotcloud expects a <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/dotcloud/wsgi.py">wsgi.py</a> file in the root of the project directory.</p>
<h4>Heroku</h4>
<p>Heroku recommends using <a href="http://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a>. Simply add gunicorn to your requirements.txt and INSTALLED_APPS, and create a file called Procfile in the root of your repo, that contains the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">web: gunicorn hellodjango.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT</pre>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>All of the providers expect a requirements.txt file to be in the root of the project directory except for OpenShift which uses the more Pythonic way of defining dependencies in a setup.py file. You can still reference your requirements.txt file using <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/openshift/setup.py#L15">this trick</a>.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p><strong>Stackato</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/stackato/stackato.yml">example stackato.yml</a>) and <strong>Dotcloud</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/dotcloud/dotcloud.yml">example dotcloud.yml</a>) both use a YAML file to define configuration information about your app (i.e. what database to create and bind)</p>
<p><strong>OpenShift</strong> doesn't seem to have a configuration file, so you have to add the cartridges (database) with a separate command.</p>
<p><strong>Heroku</strong> uses a Procfile but most of the configuration is done using the config and addons commands. </p>
<h3>Management commands</h3>
<p>When it comes time to provide instructions for what should be done when you do a deploy, each provider has a slightly different way of handling these management commands (syncdb, collectstatic, migrate, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Stackato</strong> uses <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/stackato/stackato.yml#L17">post-staging hooks</a> in the stackato.yml file.</p>
<p><strong>Dotcloud</strong> uses a simple <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/dotcloud/postinstall">postinstall</a> bash script.</p>
<p><strong>OpenShift</strong> uses a <a href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/blob/openshift/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy">deploy</a> bash script in the .openshift/action_hooks directory.</p>
<p><strong>Heroku</strong> does most of these things for you automatically and you can disable them by adding a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets#disabling-collectstatic">collectstatic_disabled</a> marker to the .heroku directory.</p>
<h3>Background processes with Celery</h3>
<p>Many advanced Django applications require the use of background job processing using <a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a>, a distributed task queue. Which PaaS providers support Celery?</p>
<p><strong>Stackato</strong> supposedly had Celery support at one time as evidenced by <a href="http://community.activestate.com/node/7585">this thread</a>, but the <a href="https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/celery-demo/commit/cd74b1cabcd515d4afb50d4a8e6dcd51a2b4d271">latest commit on the celery-demo</a> app is that it no longer works.</p>
<p><strong>OpenShift</strong> supposedly has Celery support according to <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/forums/openshift/problem-with-starting-celery-on-the-openshift-python-26-environment">this thread</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=814991">this closed bug</a>, but I don't see any definitive documentation about how to set it up on OpenShift.</p>
<p><strong>Dotcloud</strong> has a complete documentation page on <a href="http://docs.dotcloud.com/tutorials/python/django-celery/">how to use Django and Celery on Dotcloud</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Heroku </strong>lets you <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django#running-a-worker">run Celery as just another worker</a>. </p>
<h3 class="p1">So who took the 1st prize trophy home?</h3>
<p>All of the PaaS providers are winners in my book, because they're making our jobs as developers easier! But there are clearly pros/cons for each one:</p>
<h4>Stackato</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>runs anywhere (EC2, VirtualBox, VMWare, HPCloud, etc.)</li>
<li>recent versions of MySQL and PostgreSQL and support for most other services</li>
<li>you can apt-get Ubuntu packages</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>long deploy times due to rebuilding the virtualenv on every deploy</li>
<li>no hosted offering, so if you want to use it you need to deploy it yourself to EC2 or HP Cloud</li>
</ul>
<h4>OpenShift</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open source and backed by a company (Redhat) known for open source community building</li>
<li>Zero downtime deploys with Jenkins builds and hot_deploys</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Older versions of Python 2.6 and PostgreSQL 8.4</li>
<li>Bit clunky handling of git repos. Add your app's source as a remote, rather than adding OpenShift git repo as a remote</li>
<li>Missing built-in services that other PaaS' have (Redis, Memcached, RabbitMQ)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dotcloud</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.dotcloud.com/">Great documentation</a></li>
<li>Very flexible platform - ex: can use a script to <a href="http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.9/tutorials/python/django/#creating-your-database">tell Dotcloud exactly how to create your database</a>, control with <a href="http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.9/guides/nginx/">your own nginx.conf</a></li>
<li>Built-in support for <a href="http://docs.dotcloud.com/0.9/services/">just about any service you'd want</a></li>
<li>Zero-downtime and hot deploys with <a href="http://blog.dotcloud.com/get-to-know-our-new-build-system">Granite</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility adds some complexity</li>
</ul>
<h4>Heroku</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django">Good documentation</a> (including e-book <a href="http://www.theherokuhackersguide.com/">Heroku Hacker's Guide</a>)</li>
<li>Large community of developers using Heroku (more likely you'll be able to get your question answered)</li>
<li>Large ecosystem of <a href="http://addons.heroku.com">3rd party add-ons</a></li>
<li>Easiest deployment - Heroku auto-detects Django app and sets most things up automagically (syncdb, collectstatic, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No serving of static assets, so you have to <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets">use Amazon S3</a></li>
<li>No persisted storage, so you have to use something like <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3">Amazon S3 for storing uploaded media</a></li>
<li>No built-in MySQL database service (have to <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/amazon_rds">use Amazon RDS</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.heroku.com/pricing/#2-0">Expensive</a> once you exceed the resources provided in the free tier and need a production database (starts at $50/mo)</li>
</ul>

<h3>If it ain't broke, don't fix it</h3>
<p>There were a lot of questions at the end about reliability, portability, extensibility which I think sums up the reasons that people are still not jumping on these PaaS platforms. When you've got something that works (Fabric file that pushes to AWS), why change it?</p>
<p>Several people contacted me afterwards and said that after my talk, they are now reconsidering their opinion of PaaS providers and might dump the Linode, Rackspace, AWS servers that they're babysitting in favor of a PaaS deployment solution.</p>
<h3>The Future of PaaS</h3>
<p>PaaS is still in its infancy and it will be interesting to see over the next few years what happens in the developer ecosystem as these platforms mature. There will no doubt be more consolidation, and hopefully some standardization around common formats.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to define a generic deploy.yml file in your code repo that is consumed by each PaaS provider and translated into their specific way of doing things.</p>
<p>At the last <a href="http://djangocon.us/sprints">DjangoCon 2012 sprint</a>, we started working on a project called <a href="https://github.com/natea/django-deployer">django-deployer</a>, to attempt to make a PaaS-agnostic deployment tool for Django. We added support for Stackato and Dotcloud and then the sprint was over, and I haven't had time to revisit it. But if anyone is interested in working on this, let me know!</p>
<h3>What's next</h3>
<p>I only had time in this presentation to cover four PaaS providers, but there are others that have Python/Django support including Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, CloudFoundry, AppFog and even Microsoft Azure!</p>
<p>What would you like the next blog post to be?  Leave a comment below to express your preference!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional PaaS providers</strong> compared like we already did with these four</li>
<li><strong>Pricing comparison</strong> showing for an average Django application what the costs are on each provider</li>
<li><strong>Deployment time durations</strong> - statistics about deployment times (how long is the first push, subsequent deploys)</li>
<li><strong>Scaling your app on a PaaS</strong></li>
<li>something else?</li>

        <p>We're huge fans of Django, the Python web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. We not only provide 1-click deployment of a <a href="http://dashboard.appsembler.com/dashboard">dozen or so Django web applications</a>, but we also use Django for this website and the <a href="http://dashboard.appsembler.com">Appsembler dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>I started the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/">Django Boston user group</a> in 2008, and we've had around 30 meetups to date. Last year Kevin Grinberg reached out to me and said that he was compiling a list of companies in Boston that were using Django. He was under a tight editorial deadline for BostInno, so we <a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/messages/13022108/">put out a call to the mailing list</a>, and within 24 hours we had over 50 companies respond to <a href="http://appsembler.wufoo.com/forms/companies-using-django-in-the-boston-area/">a survey</a> describing how and why they were using Django!</p>
<p>Among the respondents were well-known companies and organizations like Adobe, Akamai, Boston.com, Boston University, Hewlett Packard, Hubspot, WGBH and Harvard Medical School, as well as up-and-coming startups such as Locately, CustomMade and WebReply. See the article that Kevin wrote <a href="http://bostinno.com/2011/03/31/boston-companies-using-django/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It's been a year since we compiled this list, and judging from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/messages/archive/">the activity on the Django Boston mailing list</a>, there are a lot of companies hiring Django developers. We'd like to do it a bit differently this time and make it more collaborative and self-sustaining. inspired by the Boston Ruby group's Github wiki page with a <a href="https://github.com/bostonrb/bostonrb/wiki/Companies">list of companies in the Boston area that are working with Ruby</a>, we put together this wiki page with <a href="https://github.com/DjangoBoston/DjangoBoston/wiki/Companies-using-Django-in-Massachusetts">Companies using Django in Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/DjangoBoston/DjangoBoston/wiki/Companies-using-Django-in-Massachusetts"><img alt="" class="img_right" height="450" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/site_media/media/uploads/blog/django-companies-in-boston.png" width="400" />View the list of Companies using Django in Massachusetts</a></h3>
<p>If your company is not listed, or you want to edit the entry for your company, simply click in the <strong>Edit Page</strong> button or fork the entire repo, make the change and submit a pull request. We'll review the change and update the wiki page. Hopefully, this will make it easier to maintain an up-to-date page since every one is responsible for making sure their info is correct. Let me know if you have a better idea of how to manage this process.</p><img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/appsembler/tGwU/~4/5qv7lXMwKdY" width="1" />

        <p>OpenShift is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that lets you quickly and easily deploy Django/Python apps to a production hosting environment. The OpenShift software is open source so you can either run it on servers that you own or rent, or you can use Redhat's hosted OpenShift service at <a class="reference external" href="http://openshift.redhat.com">http://openshift.redhat.com</a></p>
<p>This is the third article in <a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blog/django-deployment-using-paas/">a series about deploying Django web applications using a PaaS</a>. I'll walk you through the steps to deploy <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blog/mezzanine-a-django-based-alternative-to-wordpress/">Mezzanine</a>, a popular Django-based blogging and content management system (CMS).</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is install the OpenShift client (rhc). We're assuming that you're on Linux or MacOSX and have Ruby already installed:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ sudo gem install rhc
</pre>
<p>Next we'll run the setup which creates a config file and SSH keypair:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc setup
</pre>
<p>I found that at least on MacOSX, I had to add the SSH key and start the SSH agent:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ ssh-agent
</pre>
<p>To make sure that you have everything set up properly, you can run some tests which should all pass:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc domain status
</pre>
<div class="section" id="quick-n-dirty-instructions">
<h3>Quick 'n dirty instructions</h3>
<p>If you don't want to go through the entire example below, but just want a shortcut to deploying Mezzanine, you can do the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc app create -a mezzanineopenshift -t python 2.6
$ rhc app cartridge add -c mysql-5.1 -a mezzanineopenshift
$ cd mezzanineopenshift
$ git remote add paasbakeoff git://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff.git
$ git fetch paasbakeoff
$ git merge paasbakeoff/openshift
$ git push
</pre>
<p>The repository that contains the code used in this example can be found in the <cite>openshift</cite> branch: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/tree/openshift">https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff/tree/openshift</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-app">
<h3>Creating the app</h3>
<p>Now we'll create a new app for our Mezzanine site:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc app create -a mezz -t python-2.6
Password: ******

Creating application 'mezz'
===========================

  Scaling:   no
  Cartridge: python-2.6
  Namespace: natea
  Gear Size: default

Your application's domain name is being propagated worldwide (this might take a minute)...

    SSH URL   = ssh://0e94a6186e07430f8d9b989fdf702362@mezz-natea.rhcloud.com

    python-2.6

RESULT:
Application mezz was created.
</pre>
<p>Check to see that it is in fact running:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc app show mezz --state
Password: ******

RESULT:
Geargroup python-2.6 is started
</pre>
<p>You'll notice that it created the app with the URL mezz-natea.rhcloud.com. That's because "natea" is my namespace. In OpenShift, each app is a "gear" and with the free account you only get 3 gears. <a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/faq/what-is-a-gear">A gear</a> is a container with a set of resources that allows users to run their applications. OpenShift runs many gears on each virtual machine and dynamically distributes gears across them.</p>
<p>Applications are made up of at least one framework that is contained in a cartridge and runs on one or more gears. Additional cartridges can be added to the application on the same or different gears.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inspecting-the-auto-generated-git-repository">
<h3>Inspecting the auto-generated git repository</h3>
<p>You'll also notice that there is a Git URL and an SSH URL. A git repo has already been cloned to my computer, and using the SSH credentials, I can login to the remote instance and poke around - although unlike the Stackato PaaS, we can't install arbitrary system packages using apt-get or yum.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the git repo that was created:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ cd mezz

</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-dependencies-in-the-setup-py-file">
<h3>Defining dependencies in the setup.py file</h3>
<p>Unlike the other PaaS providers that use a <cite>requirements.txt</cite>, with OpenShift they use a more Pythonic way of requiring a <cite>setup.py</cite> to be in your repo. In this file you define all of your Python package dependencies.</p>
<p>Since we're deploying Mezzanine, we only have one package to list in our setup.py file:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(name='paasbakeoff',
    version='1.0',
    author='Nate Aune',
    author_email='nate@appsembler.com',
    url='https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff',
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
    description='Example Mezzanine CMS deploy to OpenShift PaaS',
    install_requires=['Mezzanine==1.2.4',],
)
</pre>
<p>Now we can install Mezzanine into our virtualenv with:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ python setup.py develop
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-skeleton-mezzanine-project">
<h3>Creating a new skeleton Mezzanine project</h3>
<p>Next we use the <cite>mezzanine-project</cite> command that comes with Mezzanine to create a new project:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ mezzanine-project mywebsite
$ ls mywebsite
-rw-r--r--  1 nateaune  staff      0 Nov 13 21:35 __init__.py
drwxr-xr-x  2 nateaune  staff    238 Nov 13 21:37 deploy
-rw-r--r--  1 nateaune  staff  15282 Nov 13 21:35 fabfile.py
-rw-r--r--  1 nateaune  staff    548 Nov 13 21:35 local_settings.py
-rw-r--r--  1 nateaune  staff    898 Nov 13 21:35 manage.py
drwxr-xr-x  2 nateaune  staff    102 Nov 13 21:37 requirements
-rw-r--r--  1 nateaune  staff  13115 Nov 13 21:37 settings.py
-rw-r--r--  1 nateaune  staff   3955 Nov 13 21:35 urls.py
</pre>
<p>You can see that this is a standard Django project directory layout, with manage.py, settings.py and urls.py files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tell-setup-py-to-reference-project-txt-optional">
<h3>Tell setup.py to reference project.txt (optional)</h3>
<p>Mezzanine includes it's requirements in a <cite>requirements/project.txt</cite> file, so we can tell our <cite>setup.py</cite> to use this file instead of hardcoding the dependencies. This means we only need to add new requirements to <cite>project.txt</cite> instead of keeping both of these files up-to-date:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">import os
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

setup(name='paasbakeoff',
    version='1.0',
    author='Nate Aune',
    author_email='nate@appsembler.com',
    url='https://github.com/appsembler/paasbakeoff',
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
    description='Example Mezzanine CMS deploy to OpenShift PaaS',
    install_requires=open('%s/mywebsite/requirements/project.txt' % os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR', PROJECT_ROOT)).readlines(),
)
</pre>
<p>You'll notice that we're referencing <cite>OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR</cite> here to indicate the root of our repo, but it will fallback to <cite>PROJECT_ROOT</cite> if it doesn't find that in the environment. We'll explain these OpenShift environment variables more later.</p>
<p>Note: this is not a necessary step for deploying Mezzanine to OpenShift. It's optional and only mentioned here for convenience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-wsgi-application">
<h3>Creating the wsgi application</h3>
<p>Next we need to edit the <cite>/wsgi/application</cite> file to tell OpenShift how to bind to our application. Replace the <cite>application</cite> file in the <cite>wsgi</cite> directory with this:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import sys

sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR']))

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mywebsite.settings'

virtenv = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + 'python-2.6/virtenv/'
os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = os.path.join(virtenv, 'lib/python2.6/site-packages')

virtualenv = os.path.join(virtenv, 'bin/activate_this.py')
try:
    execfile(virtualenv, dict(__file__=virtualenv))
except IOError:
    pass
#
# IMPORTANT: Put any additional includes below this line.  If placed above this
# line, it's possible required libraries won't be in your searchable path
#

import django.core.handlers.wsgi
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
</pre>
<p>We're adding the <cite>OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR</cite> to our Python path, so that <cite>mywebsite</cite> will be found, and then we're setting <cite>mywebsite.settings</cite> as our <cite>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</cite>.</p>
<p>We're also defining the virtual environment as <cite>python-2.6/virtenv/</cite> inside the <cite>OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR</cite>. If you're wondering what all the environment variables are, you can SSH into the environment and run <cite>env</cite> or you can consult <a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/page/openshift-environment-variables">this page</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-and-bind-the-database">
<h3>Create and bind the database</h3>
<p>We could use a SQLite database and store that in OpenShift's persisted <cite>/data/</cite> directory, but MySQL or PostgreSQL are more suitable databases to use in production, so we'll show how to set those up with OpenShift.</p>
<p>To bind a database to this "gear", you must add what OpenShift calls a <a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/faq/what-is-a-cartridge">cartridge</a>. Cartridges are the containers that house the framework or components that can be used to create an application. One or more cartridges run on each gear or the same cartridge can run on many gears for clustering or scaling.</p>
<p>Let's add the MySQL cartridge:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc cartridge add -c mysql-5.1 -a mezz
Password: ******

Adding 'mysql-5.1' to application 'mezz'
Success
mysql-5.1
=========
  Properties
  ==========
    Connection URL = mysql://127.12.26.129:3306/
    Database Name  = mezz
    Password       = **********
    Username       = admin
</pre>
<p>If you'd rather use PostgreSQL, the command is similar to the one above for creating a MySQL database:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc cartridge add -c postgresql-8.4 -a mezz
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="telling-django-about-the-database-openshift-created-for-us">
<h3>Telling Django about the database OpenShift created for us</h3>
<p>Now we need to make some changes to the <cite>settings.py</cite> file so that our Django app will work with the database that OpenShift just created for us.</p>
<p>Edit the <cite>DATABASES</cite> section of the <cite>settings.py</cite> file to have the following (yeah, this code could be cleaner):</p>
<pre class="brush: python">import os
import urlparse

DATABASES = {}
if 'OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL' in os.environ:
    url = urlparse.urlparse(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL'))

    DATABASES['default'] = {
        'ENGINE' : 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': os.environ['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME'],
        'USER': url.username,
        'PASSWORD': url.password,
        'HOST': url.hostname,
        'PORT': url.port,
        }

elif 'OPENSHIFT_POSTGRESQL_DB_URL' in os.environ:
    url = urlparse.urlparse(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_POSTGRESQL_DB_URL'))

    DATABASES['default'] = {
        'ENGINE' : 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': os.environ['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME'],
        'USER': url.username,
        'PASSWORD': url.password,
        'HOST': url.hostname,
        'PORT': url.port,
        }

else:
    DATABASES['default'] = {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': 'dev.db',
        'USER': '',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': '',
        'PORT': '',
        }
</pre>
<p>Again, we're using OpenShift-specific environment variables to test if there is a MySQL or PostgreSQL database available, and if so we're extracting the database name, username, password, hostname and post from the provided URL string.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-a-deploy-script">
<h3>Create a deploy script</h3>
<p>You'll notice that there is a <cite>.openshift</cite> directory in the project that contains another directory called <cite>action_hooks</cite>. This is where we define scripts that will run on every build or on every deploy.</p>
<p>Replace the <cite>deploy</cite> script with the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">#!/bin/bash
# This deploy hook gets executed after dependencies are resolved and the
# build hook has been run but before the application has been started back
# up again.  This script gets executed directly, so it could be python, php,
# ruby, etc.

source ${OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR}python-2.6/virtenv/bin/activate

export PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=${OPENSHIFT_HOME_DIR}python-2.6/virtenv/lib/python-2.6/site-packages

echo "Executing 'python ${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}mywebsite/manage.py syncdb --noinput'"
python "$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR"mywebsite/manage.py syncdb --noinput

echo "Executing 'python ${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}mywebsite/manage.py collectstatic --noinput -v0'"
python "$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR"mywebsite/manage.py collectstatic --noinput -v0
</pre>
<p>Here we can define any Django management commands that we want to be run on every deploy, namely <cite>syncdb</cite> and <cite>collectstatic</cite>. If we were using South for database schema migrations (as all Django projects should do), we could add the <cite>migrate</cite> command as well.</p>
<p>You can read about all the different action hooks (pre-receive, pre-build, build, deploy, post-deploy) <a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/developers/deploying-and-building-applications">here</a>.</p>
<p>Example of a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openshift/reviewboard-example/blob/master/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy">more sophisticated deploy script</a> for deploying Reviewboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-static-media">
<h3>Handling static media</h3>
<p>OpenShift provides a directory <cite>wsgi/static</cite> that can be exposed to Apache and serve up static assets, so we need to tell Django to collect the static media to this directory. Replace the <cite>STATIC_ROOT</cite> definition in <cite>settings.py</cite> with the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">if 'OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR' in os.environ:
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'), 'wsgi', 'static')
else:
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, STATIC_URL.strip("/"))
</pre>
<p>Next we need to tell Apache to serve up media at <cite>/static/</cite> from this directory. Add an <cite>.htaccess</cite> file to <cite>/wsgi/static/</cite> directory:</p>
<pre class="brush: text">RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^application/static/(.+)$ /static/$1 [L]
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-uploaded-media">
<h3>Handling uploaded media</h3>
<p>OpenShift will wipe out the remote repo directory on every deploy, so if you want to make sure uploaded media files are persisted, you need to store them in the special <cite>/data/</cite> dir that OpenShift provides. Replace the <cite>MEDIA_ROOT</cite> definition in <cite>settings.py</cite> with the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: python">if 'OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR' in os.environ:
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR'), 'media')
else:
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, *MEDIA_URL.strip("/").split("/"))
</pre>
<p>We also need to symlink this directory into <cite>/wsgi/static/media/</cite> so that the media assets will be served up by Apache. Add the following to the <cite>build</cite> script in <cite>.openshift/action_hooks</cite>:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">#!/bin/bash
# This is a simple build script and will be executed on your CI system if
# available.  Otherwise it will execute while your application is stopped
# before the deploy step.  This script gets executed directly, so it
# could be python, php, ruby, etc.

if [ ! -d $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/media ]; then
mkdir $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/media

<div class="section" id="subsequent-deploys">
<h3>Subsequent deploys</h3>
<p>One thing that is nice about OpenShift is that the next time we deploy, it will see that these eggs are already installed in the virtual environment and not install them again. If we want to force a clean build, we can add a <cite>force_clean_build</cite> marker file in the <cite>.openshift/markers/</cite> directory.</p>
<p>Since downloading all the packages and installing them is the most time-consuming part of the build and deploy process, this feature significantly speeds up subsequent deploys.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="avoiding-downtime-during-deploys">
<h3>Avoiding downtime during deploys</h3>
<p>You can also set a marker <cite>hot_deploy</cite> which will dynamically reload python scripts via WSGI Daemon mode, so that you don't experience any downtime when deploying a new version of your app.</p>
<p>Or you can <a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/OpenShift/2.0/html/User_Guide/sect-OpenShift-User_Guide-Using_the_Jenkins_Embedded_Build_System.html">use Jenkins</a> to avoid downtime when deploying.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deploying-an-existing-git-repo">
<h3>Deploying an existing Git repo</h3>
<p>Since OpenShift creates a git repo for your app, if you have code living in an existing Github repo, you need to pull that into the OpenShift git repo before you can push it. The OpenShift documentation says to do it this way:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ rhc app create -a mydjangoapp -t python-2.6
$ cd mydjangoapp
$ git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift/django-example.git
$ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
</pre>
<p>This will pull in the code from the <cite>django-example</cite> and merge it with the repo that OpenShift created on your local machine. You can then deploy this with the usual <cite>git push</cite>.</p>
<p>I've found that you can also just fetch the code from the remote repo and merge it like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">$ git remote add django-example git://github.com/openshift/django-example.git
$ git fetch django-example
$ git merge django-example/master
</pre>

        <p>Sometimes just doing one major infrastructure move at once isn't quite enough to whet my appetite.</p>
<p>Last week, me and the rest of the Lanyrd team pulled off two major infrastructure
changes in two hours - see <a class="reference external" href="http://lanyrd.com/blog/2012/lanyrds-big-move/">our blog post</a> on the move
for some background information as well as an overview of the timeline.</p>
<p>I'd like to take a closer look at the technical details of this move and show
how exactly we pulled off changing our hosting provider, database vendor and
operating system version all in one go.</p>
<div class="section" id="hosting">
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>For many startups, there comes a time when the switch to dedicated hardware
and a more 'traditional' hosting model makes sense, and Lanyrd is one of those -
we're fortunate to be at least partially a content-based site, and have two
distinct advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Most traffic spikes are to one or two conference pages, and are an easily cacheable pattern.</li>
<li>Conferences are planned well in advance, so we get good notification of when to expect high-traffic periods for more interactive use.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that we're not subject to a huge amount of daily variation or
unpredicted traffic spikes, and even if we get some, we have enough overhead to
deal with them as we've overprovisioned the new servers slightly.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.softlayer.com">Softlayer</a> were our dedicated hosts of choice - I've had good experiences of
them in the past (Minecraft Forums ran off of them for a while after we outgrew
Linode) as have some of my colleagues in the ops side of the industry. In
addition, they also have billed-by-the-hour virtual servers available in the
same datacentres as your dedicated servers, meaning that even if we overgrow
our fixed capacity we can have a new frontend box up and serving requests in
about 10 minutes.</p>
<div class="right_note"><h4>Note</h4><p class="note">The last time I did a move like this was moving Epio from AWS to real hardware back in 2011. That was slightly tougher since it was itself a hosting service, and we had to have a few minutes of downtime per app.</p></div>
<p>Changing hosting is a well-known challenge, and one I've done several times
before, so we used the tried-and-tested method of putting the old site into
read-only mode, syncing the databases across to our new site, repointing the
DNS (and proxying requests from the old IP) and enabling the new site.</p>
<p>For maximum reliability, I scripted the data sync step, and did several dry
runs of it. Of course, the move was nowhere near as simple as that.</p>
<div class="post-image"><img src="http://www.aeracode.org/static/media/cache/d3/52/d35242dd8a951f80c46f4abb469f56ba.jpg" /><p class="caption">Lanyrd may or may not run on something like this now. Via scjody on Flickr.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="databases">
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>It's well known that I'm not a fan of MySQL, but I'm also a practical person -
Lanyrd's been running on it for over two years, and there's no point in fixing
what isn't broken.</p>
<p>That said, our tables are now at the size where adding a new column or index
takes several minutes, and in the case of one table over fifteen minutes - locking
the entire table in the process. We can't take that kind of downtime on our core
tables, and so our primary reason to move was the ability to get transactional
and/or zero-time column additions out of PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>There are other benefits to moving - PostgreSQL will scale to the eight cores
we have in our new servers a lot better, the query planner is a lot more capable
at dealing with JOINs, and dump and restore is an order of magnitude faster,
allowing us to test code changes against a copy of live data much more readily.</p>
<p>However, changing your database is one of the most difficult things you can do
to yourself if you're running ops for a decently-sized website. The main
difficulty is converting from MySQL to PostgreSQL format.</p>
<p>We bandied around a few ideas, including a wonderfully crazy idea that we could
intercept the MySQL replication protocol and translate it into commands on a
PostgreSQL slave, but in the end, and after a few prototypes and timing tests,
I settled on a dump-convert-load strategy; we'd dump the data from MySQL,
convert the dump into PostgreSQL format, and load it into a blank PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>The trick to making the conversion step fast is doing the minimal amount of
work possible to the INSERT lines - while my first converter loaded every
INSERT, converted the types (for example, boolean columns were TINYINT in MySQL
but BOOLEAN in PostgreSQL) and wrote the new INSERT out, that was very slow,
requiring several hours to convert on our tens of gigabytes of data.</p>
<div class="right_note"><h4>Note</h4><p class="note">MySQL has a 'PostgreSQL compatible' dump format, which actually isn't compatible, but a good place to start from.</p></div>
<p>Instead, I settled on just copying the old MySQL types in the new tables,
re-using the old INSERT statements, and then performing type conversion
at the end using an ALTER TABLE statement. This reduced the conversion time
from several hours to a couple of minutes, and only added around ten minutes
to the restore time from the extra ALTER statements.</p>
<p>The script we used to do the conversion in the end <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lanyrd/mysql-postgresql-converter/">is available from Lanyrd's
GitHub account</a> - it's quite specific to Lanyrd
and Django in particular, but I hope that it will prove useful if you're
considering a similar move.</p>
<div class="post-image"><img src="http://www.aeracode.org/static/media/cache/60/b1/60b1c33214a8fe7f65f59aae6f90d9cf.jpg" /><p class="caption">Lanyrd's read-only mode banner</p></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="operating-system">
<h3>Operating System</h3>
<p>After the other two moves, this one seemed like a doddle. We were only
moving from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 - ensuring we were on the latest LTS.</p>
<div class="right_note"><h4>Note</h4><p class="note">There are a few other Facter facts you can use for distinguishing OS releases, this was just most convenient.</p></div>
<p>We have a few custom packages and the layout of Ubuntu has changed in the
intervening two years, so we edited our Puppet files in the appropriate places
to depend on <tt class="docutils literal">$lsbdistrelease</tt>, and once we'd ironed out the edge cases
thanks to the extensive testing we did on this move it was relatively pain-free.</p>
<p>Points go to Redis and Solr for being able to read older versions of their
data format, meaning we could upgrade their versions without any expensive
re-writing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="all-together-now">
<h3>All Together Now</h3>
<p>Of course, a move like this was planned a month ahead and rehearsed for a week - see the <a class="reference external" href="http://lanyrd.com/blog/2012/lanyrds-big-move/">Lanyrd blog post</a> about that - but it's still quite exciting on the
day to execute the plan and hope it works as well as it did the day before.</p>
<div class="right_note"><h4>Note</h4><p class="note">Comments at the end of lines in requirements files aren't harmless - pip will try to interpret them.</p></div>
<p>Excitingly it didn't for the very first stage of the switchover - turning on
read-only mode - due to a rogue comment in our <tt class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</tt> file that
had slipped in the previous day. Fortunately, we fixed that once we'd spotted
it and the rest of the move went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>I'm not going to run off and move everything again next week, but it's always nice
to have something like this go pretty much exactly to plan. All I need to do
now is convince the rest of Lanyrd that we really want to run everything off of
a box of Raspberry Pis powered by a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/RoeblingPopcorn">hamster</a>.</p>
<p>After all, it's much more green.</p>

        <p>In this article I share the podcasts listen to on my daily&nbsp;commute.</p>
        <p>Note that these podcasts are not Plone or Django specific; they aren&#8217;t
        even about Python. Most of them are web related and keep me informed
        on what&#8217;s new in our field. And I also got a few really nice tips and
        tricks from&nbsp;them.</p>
        <p>This list of podcasts is usually enough to keep me busy during (most
        of) the drive to and from work. (Which totals up to about 6 hours per
        week, just to give you an&nbsp;idea.)</p>
        <p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the list in alphabetic&nbsp;order:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">ShopTalk</a> is about front end web design,

        <p><a href="https://github.com/miracle2k/webassets">webassets</a> is an application that manages (compress and join) static files like JavaScript or CSS (LESS, SASS too) files. It can work with various frameworks, including Django. Everything is described in the <a href="http://elsdoerfer.name/files/docs/webassets/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Compressed files have slightly smaller size and they load faster. One file made out of multiple CSS or JS files reduces the amount of HTTP requests needed to load the website. That also improves the load times.</p>

        <p class="discreet">

        <p>
Securing a view in Django can be done easily. Just add a few <code>if</code> statements to the code
to check for conditions (like permissions). Unfortunately splattering if statements
throughout the code has some downsides. One of which is the weakest link problem.
</p>
<p>
Security within web-apps depends on all available views in the system. That means that if
only one view is vulnerable the whole system might be compromised. Since each and every
view can be accessed directly the burden on software developers to enforce security
increases with the amount views that are added to the system.
</p>
<p>
To get declarative security for Django we start out by writing a generic view mixin. This
mixin can be used with all other generic views.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
from django.contrib.auth.views import redirect_to_login

class SecureMixin(object):
    context = None
    permission = None

    def dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs):
        self.context = self.context(*args, **kwargs)
        if not self.context.has_permission(request.user, self.permission):
            return redirect_to_login(request.get_full_path())
        # Security cleared, go ahead and execute the normal view code
        return super(SecureMixin, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
</pre>

<p>
The <em>dispatch</em> method is the first point of entry for Django's generic views. This class
will be used as the first mixin and therefore override the default behavior. As you can
see the main security assertion will happen in the <em>has_permission</em> method of the
<em>context</em>.
</p>

<p>
A context should represent a logical place within your application. Say we have an address
like <em>/blogs/john/posts/12/</em> where john would be a user that has his own blog and
12 the id of his latest post. In this case the <em>context</em> of the view would be
<em>user: john</em> and <em>post: 12</em>.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at an example implementation of this context:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class BlogPostContext(object):

    def __init__(self, username, post_id, *args, **kwargs):
        self.user = get_object_or_404(User.objects, username=username)
        self.post = get_object_or_404(self.user.blogpost_set, id=post_id)
        
    def has_permission(user, permission):
        if self.post.author.id == user.id:
            return True
        if permission == 'view':
            return self.post.state == 'published'
        return False
</pre>

<p>
The first thing this class does is to load both the user and the post objects from the 
database. It also makes sure that the post must be authored by the proper user by fetching
it from the user instead of going directly to the BlogPost model.
</p>

<p>
The BlogPostContext also has a simple has_permission implementation. This will anything
as long as the current user is the author. It only allows other people to view the 
context when the blog post has been published.
</p>

<p>Let's write a simple detail view to tie it all together:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class BlogPostView(SecureMixin, generic.DetailView):
    context_class = BlogPostContext
    permission = 'view'
    
    def get_object(self):
        return self.context.post
</pre>

<p>
The <em>SecureMixin</em> is placed before <em>DetailView</em> to make sure it's 
version of <em>dispatch</em> is called. Next is the context_class and permission 
assignment. These just setup the proper values for this view. Finally there's the
<em>get_object</em> method. This is overridden to reuse the object that has been loaded
already. It's a small efficiency booster since it saves a query.
</p>
    
<p>
It is easy to create many more views in the same context now that the context has been 
created. Each view can be easily secured by subclassing it from the SecureMixin and 
setting the proper class attributes. The result is that each view has a simple declarative
security declaration.
</p>

<p>
This solution does not offer security for the code that runs within the view itself. So
care has to be taken as always with this as well. It does offer a very generic and easy
to verify base level of security to all views that use it.
</p>

<p>
In this example permissions are used as a verification system. This could easily be 
replaced with a role based policy or some other form. Another nice trick is to create 
different contexts and use subclassing to do general assertions in one context and more 
specific checks in it's subclass.
</p>

<p>
You can take a look at the <a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid framework</a>
 to find out more about how this concept can be applied. The solution presented here is 
 conceptually based on the 
<a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/security.html">security
 system in Pyramid</a>.

        <p>A Django project normally contains several models, forms and code to glue them together (views). Django is normally pretty good at avoid repetitive code by use of generic views and abstractions over common operations.</p>
<p>There are instances however when even Django's abstractions aren't abstract enough. I recently had this on a project where I needed to create questionnaire system.</p>
<p>The system had several (paper) forms that each needed to be filled in. Since the forms contain to many questions each had to be cut up into several sub forms.</p>
<p>An easy solution to this problem is creating a model per entire form. Screens would be made from small forms that would be hand coded (to select the fields that needed to be displayed).</p>
<p>This setup works fine, but it duplicates some code and needs a lot of typing. What I really wanted was to be able to define a simple datastructure that contained all the info needed for a form. Something that I could even show to my client so that they would understand what would go on each screen.</p>
<p>I came up with a solution that uses Python's meta programming facilities to generate both the models, the forms and the views which tie them together.</p>
<p>The trick is to use the <code>type</code> function. This function accepts a name, a list of superclasses and a dictionary which will become the class dict.</p>
<p>The first step was to define my data structure using Python datatypes. A simple example is given below:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">QUIZ = (
    {'name': 'Favorites',
     'questions': ['food', 'movie', 'color']},
    {'name': 'Knowledge',
     'questions': ['languages', 'degrees', 'certificates']}
)
</pre>
<p>Next, I created a function which scans this data structure and generates model classes.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">def generate_model(info):
    name = info['name']
    questions = info['questions']

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return '/{}/{}/'.format(name.lower(), self.id)

    def __unicode__(self):
        return u', '.join([getattr(self, q) for q in questions])

    fields = {'__module__': __name__,
              'get_absolute_url': get_absolute_url,
              '__unicode__': __unicode__}
    for question in questions:
        fields[question] = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    return type(name, (models.Model,), fields)
</pre>
<p>To make sure Django can find the models they need to be assigned to the models.py module. This can be done by placing the following code in it:</p>
<p>for topic in QUIZ:
    locals()[topic['name']] = generate_model(topic)</p>
<p>Now the views need to be generated. For this the <code>type</code> function can be used as well.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">def generate_views(info):
    name = info['name']
    fields = {'model': getattr(models, name)}
    views = []
    for view_class in ('CreateView', 'UpdateView', 'ListView'):
        views.append(type(name + view_class, (getattr(generic, view_class),), fields))
    return views

for topic in models.QUIZ:
    for view in generate_views(topic):
        locals()[view.__name__] = view
</pre>
<p>Finally a urls need to be setup to link up with the generated views.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">def generate_urls():
    urls = []
    for topic in QUIZ:
        for view_cls in ('CreateView', 'UpdateView', 'ListView'):
            urls.append(url(URL_PATTERNS[view_cls].format(topic['name'].lower()),
                            getattr(views, topic['name'] + view_cls).as_view()))
    return urls

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    *generate_urls()
)
</pre>
<p>Together this makes for a pretty nice way to avoid repetition in code. It works best when you prototype a sample of the code that needs to be generated before hand. That way it's easy to work out any problems in a familiar and easy to debug environment.</p>

<p>Several reasons - here's a few:</p>

        </p>

        <p>One often underestimated challenge of good a webapp design and implementation is security. Most webframeworks nowadays have measures at some level to protect against common security problems. Though it is nice that they take at least some work away from the app developer they still leave a big problem on the table; design and implementation bugs.</p>
<p>The security of a system is only as good as it's weakest link. This means that only one badly coded webpage can severely weaken the system as a whole. Because most webapp security is handled on the code / app layer such a bug can be easily introduced.</p>
<p>In most applications it might be possible to limit the impact of such a bug. This can be done by having an additional layer of security at the datamodel level. Modern  database systems provide facilities for limiting what a (database) user can do.</p>
<p>This means you can assign on a table (or column) level if the database user can select, insert, update or delete records. Combining this with a setup where a webapp does not use just one single database user but several an additional layer of security can be had with very little work.</p>
<p>I recently wanted to use database level security for a project. The app allowed for a clean separation of super users and normal end users. It also had several tables that where always going to be off-limits to normal users.</p>
<p>Another nice aspect, security wise, of this webapp is that normal user accounts are only managed by the super users. Under no circumstance did they need any other than select priviliges on the user table.</p>
<p>So to develop te app I planned to split it up into two distinct applications. One for normal users and one for super users. Both would connect with different users to the PostgreSQL database. The database could limit the normal user based on limited granted permissions.</p>
<p>This sounded good until I met with the reality of my webapp. I had built it using the Django framework. Django has a feature that updates the user table each time someone logs-in. The feature got in the way of limiting write access for normal users to the user table. This means that normal users would get update rights, which is something I did not want.</p>
<p>I tried to enable only updates on the last_login column, a feature which PostgreSQL seemed to support. Unfortunately Django uses it's ORM to update the user record. And the ORM updates the whole record, regardless of what has been changed.</p>
<p>Since this app did not need the last login timestamp I just disabled it. For those interested, the following code can be placed in a urls.py to disable it in your own project:</p>

<p>This little bit of code did the trick for me. By having Django connect to the database with different users depending on the functionality needed I can now feel a little more sure that the database will disallow at least some of the issues that might be introduced.</p>
<p>Because this concept is not Django specific I hope that more app developers start thinking about if, and how, they can leverage this simple but sometimes very effective extra security layer.</p>

        <p>The buzz around the asynchronous, real-time web has been getting more and more attention lately, and for good reason. The old paradigm of thick servers and thin clients is getting outdated as the new web demands rich, fast, asynchronous, full-duplex messaging. The technologies that enable server-to-browser asynchronous messaging have been given the umbrella term "Comet," and the number of ways to provide Comet services is growing constantly. The transport options include XHR-multipart, WebSockets, and Adobe Flash Sockets, among others. Socket.IO was invented to provide a unified interface for server-browser messaging and let the developer not worry about the inconsistent browser support. In this post, I'm going to explain how to use Django with Socket.IO.</p><p>Socket.IO was developed with a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> server implementation, but work is being done to add server implementations to a variety of languages. Two such servers exist for Python, <a href="https://github.com/MrJoes/tornadio">tornadio</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Jeffrey/gevent-socketio">gevent-socketio</a>. I'm a big fan of gevent, so I will use gevent-socketio, but tornadio looks well-written and very promising.</p>
<h2>Why you should be thinking about gevent</h2>
<p>Socket.IO runs great under Node.JS, but I think it's important to highlight why I think Python and gevent need more attention (feel free to skip ahead if you have already drank the gevent koolaid). Node.JS (and its underlying V8 Javascript engine) is a pinnacle achievement for the world of Javascript. It has done two especially important things: it helped show the world that evented application servers enable extremely fast high-concurrency connections, and it helped promote Javascript as a serious language, opening the doors for powerful tools such as <a href="https://github.com/chrisdickinson/platoon">testing frameworks</a>, <a href="http://npmjs.org/">a package manager</a>, and better community code standards. Its popularity is not surprising: it's built on top of one of the world's most well-known programming languages.</p>
<p>The Python community is a bit more fragmented, with several concurrent networking libraries -- among them: twisted, tornado, gevent, eventlet, and concurrence. It's certainly harder to know where to start without a "clear winner" like we see in the Javascript community. Personally, gevent has quickly become my favorite way to write asynchronous applications. I think Python with gevent wins over Node.JS in two important ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's Python, a sane and concise language with an awesome standard library and community.</li>
<li>It uses <a href="http://packages.python.org/greenlet/">greenlets</a> instead of callbacks to provide concurrency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gevent, <del>like Node.JS,</del> is built on libevent (<em>Update: Node actually uses libev. Thanks to Travis Cline for correcting me there</em>), an underlying C library that provides a high-speed event loop. Node's concurrency model relies on callbacks to handle values from asynchronous I/O calls. This, combined with Javascript's highly nestable syntax, begs programmers to nest functions within other function calls, making callback passing a piece of cake, but I've seen this produce ugly, unreadable nested code, and I've seen programmers pull their hair out while trying to get things synchronized and avoid race conditions. In my experience, debugging an app with heavy use of callbacks is nearly impossible. Greenlet changes the game, because you can write simple "blocking" code that only blocks the current greenlet instead of the entire interpreter, allowing you to maintain stacks, along with beautiful Python stack traces.</p>
<h2>Running Django on gevent-socketio</h2>
<p>Gevent-socketio comes with one important caveat: you must use the gevent pywsgi server. This means you can't serve your WSGI app out of Apache like you might be used to doing (however, it should be possible to proxy requests from a front-end load balancer, but I haven't experimented with proxying web sockets). There's a pretty good reason for this: WSGI doesn't inherently allow web sockets. The only way this is possible is by hooking into the raw socket using the hooks provided by the pywsgi server.</p>
<p>Gevent-socketio works by creating a SocketIO handler and adding it to the WSGI "environ" dictionary before executing your WSGI app. When Django handles a request, it creates a WSGIRequest object and assigns it the environ dictionary created by pywsgi. So, if we are running Django under gevent-socketio, our SocketIO handler is available by accessing "request.environ['socketio']". I've demonstrated this by porting the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Jeffrey/gevent-socketio/src/5a0c6e249a9f/examples/">gevent-socketio example chatroom application</a> to Django. My ported code is <a href="http://github.com/codysoyland/django-socketio-example">available on Github</a>.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>I always choose to work in virtualenv, and I've created a pip requirements file that should cover what you need to get started. To run my example, clone the code on Github and install the requirements from pip:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git clone git://github.com/codysoyland/django-socketio-example.git
cd django-socketio-example
easy_install pip
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv .
source ./bin/activate
pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
</pre></div>

<p>Note the contents of pip_requirements.txt: I'm using the "tip" versions of both gevent-websocket and gevent-socketio. This is still beta-quality software, so we are using development versions. <strong>Note: Expect bugs!</strong></p>
<h2>A chat server request handler</h2>
<p>The Socket.IO calls come in like normal requests and can be handled by a view, but your view code can actually contain a long-running event loop, sending and receiving messages from your web client. Here is the view that handles Socket.IO requests:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>from django.http import HttpResponse

buffer = []

def socketio(request):
    socketio = request.environ['socketio']
    if socketio.on_connect():
        socketio.send({'buffer': buffer})
        socketio.broadcast({'announcement': socketio.session.session_id + ' connected'})

    while True:
        message = socketio.recv()

        if len(message) == 1:
            message = message[0]
            message = {'message': [socketio.session.session_id, message]}
            buffer.append(message)
            if len(buffer) &gt; 15:
                del buffer[0]
            socketio.broadcast(message)
        else:
            if not socketio.connected():
                socketio.broadcast({'announcement': socketio.session.session_id + ' disconnected'})
                break

    return HttpResponse()
</pre></div>

<p>The view is plugged into your site like any other view:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>urlpatterns += patterns('views',
    (r'^socket\.io', 'socketio'),
)
</pre></div>

<h2>Running the example</h2>
<p>Run the example by starting the server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>./run_example.py
</pre></div>

<p>Then point your browser to http://localhost:9000/.</p>
<p>If you run the example, you should see the same result as running the gevent-socketio example: a multi-client chatroom. The beauty of greenlet is at play in the line containing "socketio.recv()". This line blocks the greenlet and allows the server to keep processing other requests until a new Socket.IO message is ready to be processed. As soon as a new message is ready, the greenlet is re-awakened and the message is processed.</p>
<p>Note that we can't use our good old friend "./manage.py runserver" for this example. This is because we need to run the SocketIO server, which we import from gevent-socketio. Here is the example runner:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>PORT = 9000

import os

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings'

import django.core.handlers.wsgi
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

from socketio import SocketIOServer

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print 'Listening on port %s and on port 843 (flash policy server)' % PORT
    SocketIOServer(('', PORT), application, resource=&quot;socket.io&quot;).serve_forever()
</pre></div>

<p>This is all it takes to hook up gevent-socketio to the Django WSGIHandler. A monkey could easily make this into a custom management command if we desired.</p>
<h2>Further reading</h2>
<p>In my next post, I will explain how to scale our chatroom example to multiple web servers using ZeroMQ. Until then, I recommend checking out the following resources:</p>

                  By Cody Soyland from Planet Django.
            
            
            
                Published on <span name="publication_time">Nov 03, 2012</span>.
            
        </p>

        <p>I've been interested in the Django template language for some time now, and I've admired much of its simplicity and extendibility. I even wrote <a href="http://github.com/codysoyland/django-template-repl">a shell for it</a> <a href="http://codysoyland.com/2010/feb/17/screencast-django-template-repl/">(screencast)</a> and a <a href="http://github.com/codysoyland/django-phased">two-phase template renderer</a>. Having spent the time to understand how it works, I've also had my share of ideas on how to improve it (addition of "elif", mathematical operations in variable tags, namespaces). The pony that I've been wanting the most is probably namespaces. There has been talk of adding namespaces to Django templates for quite a while (including a <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/2539">ticket with patches</a> and some various discussions on the mailing list (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_frm/thread/2b5a4a31f0349d27">1</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_frm/thread/7bb52598b1b3b928">2</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_frm/thread/da9ed3a3116c546a">3</a>)). For years, this concept has sat dormant due to lack of discussion and interest. No pluggable solution had been offered (as far as I know), so I wrote a couple of templatetags that offer namespacing and other features while <strong>retaining backwards compatibility</strong> and <strong>not requiring a fork of Django</strong>. This code is available <a href="http://github.com/codysoyland/django-smart-load-tag">on Github as django-smart-load-tag</a>.</p><h2>Backwards compatibility</h2>
<p>Django's policy is to remain backwards compatible, and the template language is certainly no exception. In order to give the "{% load %}" tag namespacing features, it needed to be extended in a way that allows current assumptions about its behavior to remain the same. In particular, the assumption that all tags will be loaded into the global namespace by default had to stay. This means that, given a template library named "lib1" containing "tag1" and "tag2", the following code must work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% load lib1 %}
{% tag1 %}
{% tag2 %}
</pre></div>

<p>Current proposals have suggested the backwards-incompatible syntax that assumes namespaces are on by default:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% load lib1 %}
{% lib1.tag1 %}
{% lib1.tag2 %}
</pre></div>

<p>In my implementation, "load" works the same (as in the top example), but has a few keywords that control its behavior. For example, to load a library into a namespace, use "into":</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% load lib1 into lib1 %}
{% lib1.tag1 %}
{% lib1.tag2 %}
</pre></div>

<h2>Other features</h2>
<p>To load a specific tag (optionally renaming it with the "as" keyword):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% load lib1.tag1 as my_tag %}
{% my_tag %}
</pre></div>

<p>Loading from a specific app can be done using the "from" keyword:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% load lib1 from app1 into app1 %}
{% load lib1 from app2 into app2 %}
{% app1.tag1 %}
{% app2.tag1 %}
</pre></div>

<h2>To make everybody happy</h2>
<p>It has been suggested to write a separate "{% import %}" tag in order to enable namespaces by default while retaining backwards-compatibility with existing Django applications. I've also experimented with the following import syntax, and it's also included in django-smart-load-tag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% import lib1 %}
{% lib1.tag1 %}
</pre></div>

<p>Its namespace-on-by-default design can be subverted using "* from":</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% import * from lib1 %}
{% tag1 %}
</pre></div>

<p>The "as" and "from" keywords are also implemented:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>{% import lib1 as my_lib %}
{% my_lib.tag1 %}

{% import lib1 from app1 %}
{% lib1.tag1 %}
</pre></div>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
<p>If template tag namespaces are to be accepted as a core part of Django, some discussion will need to take place on what is the most correct solution for moving forward. Your comments here or on the mailing list can make a difference, and with enough contribution from the community, perhaps all my ponies will one day run free.</p>
